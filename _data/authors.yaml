    bio: I'm Alex Veroulis, a first-year student with the academic standing of a sophomore for the 2017-2018 academic year. My major is statistics, as I have an affinity for numbers, and AP Stats was by far the best class I took in high school. Also, I've engaged in sports my entire life; some of my favorites to play are water polo, racquetball, and golf. In addition, I follow football, basketball, hockey, soccer, and baseball, so I would love to become a data scientist in the sports world one day.
