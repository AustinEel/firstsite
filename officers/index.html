      <h4>Breanna Ramos</h4>
      <p class="modal-text">I am a fourth year statistics major at UCLA. I am eager to delve into sports analytics—a field that combines my two passions. Growing up, I loved to play sports such as soccer, basketball, softball, and tennis. When I wasn’t practicing my dribbling skills in my backyard or playing swish, I would watch sports events on TV with my family. Eventually, I had the opportunity to watch the 49ers, Lakers, and Dodgers live—I even attended game one of the 2017 World Series on a whim. Bruin Sports Analytics is an exceptional organization, and I am honored to be a part of it.</p>

      <h4>Konner Macias</h4>
      <p class="modal-text">I’m a fourth year Mathematics of Computation major and Statistics minor at UCLA, aiming to become a software engineer. I’m from the Sacramento Area and have grown up with sports my whole life. I mainly played junior competitive tennis and even received some DII college offers, but I couldn't turn down studying here! Formally the President of this club and the Team Captain of UCLA's competitive club tennis club, I have stepped down from the head roles to focus on my studies and the job search. My main sports of interest are tennis and basketball, though I'm a fan of all. Looking forward to a great year of sports research!<br><br>Feel free to reach out at konnermacias@ucla.edu.</p>

          <h4>Akram Almohalwas</h4>
          <p class="modal-text">My name is Akram Almohalwas, I've been a lecturer at the statistics department at UCLA since 2010. I got promoted to a continuing lecturer last year. I had my PhD in mathematics with statistics concentration from Central Michigan University. I initially worked on data mining techniques applied on gene expression data while working on my PhD dissertation. I always loved sports and following different kind of sports, especially Tennis and Basketball. I thought that using my statistical knowledge and my love for the sport I've decided to help undergraduate student to conduct little research using NBA data. Students usually are asked to read some literature regarding data mining and NBA data related research. I usually provide the research ideas to students and guide them through the research process. I get the pleasure of witnessing the AHA moments when students statistics knowledge is put to use in real world applications. I'm happy to give my students the research experience regardless how little it can be.</p>

      <h4>Nikhil Sharma</h4>
      <p class="modal-text">I’m a third-year Statistics major from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. My favorite sport is basketball, as I’ve been obsessively following the NBA since I was a child. My favorite team is the Lakers, and I credit Kobe Bryant with getting me into sports as a whole. Since I am also a Stats major, I love participating in BSA, where I can combine two things I love in numbers and sports. I hope that I can jump off from what I learn in this club into an analyst role at an NBA team. Aside from sports, I love hip-hop music; some of my favorite artists include Pusha T, ScHoolboy Q, Danny Brown, and Denzel Curry.</p>

      <p class="modal-text">I am a third year Statistics major from Temecula, CA. I grew up playing and watching hockey; my favorite team is the San Jose Sharks. I also enjoy most of the other major sports, as well as college soccer and gymnastics. I like applying analysis techniques to some of the lesser-known sports out there. My additional hobbies include astronomy, SCUBA diving, and fish/reptile breeding. I hope to pursue a career in biostatistics or sports analytics, and am thrilled to be at a school like UCLA that is a powerhouse in academics and athletics.</p>

                <p class="modal-text">I’m a fourth year Statistics major from Scottsdale, Arizona! My dream job has always been to go into sports analytics, specifically into hockey or baseball, my two favorite sports. I grew up competitively figure skating for about 11 years, which is how I first got into watching hockey around my local rink. In my free time I love going to games or on road trips! In fact, one of my favorite memories/traditions since going here is every spring, my friends and I take a road trip back home to go to a couple spring training baseball games. </p>

      <p class="modal-text">Hey guys, so I am a 3rd year Economics major with a Statistics minor! In terms of sports, in high school I played soccer, volleyball, golf, and a couple more. However, my favorite sports to watch and go to games are definitely baseball and football (and sometimes hockey since my best friend is a diehard fan). I’m from San Diego, so go Padres! Outside of this, I am also involved in VITA, my sorority, and volunteering for UCLA football. My absolute dream would be able to work as a sports statistician some day!</p>

      <p class="modal-text">I'm a 3rd year Financial Actuarial Mathematics major. I love playing all sports, but especially tennis, soccer, and basketball. I'm really interested in how analytics could help improve performance in more obscure, fringe sports, like curling, for example. I'm currently pursuing a career as an actuary, but I've always thought being involved in the management side of sports or esports would be really fun.</p>
