      <h4>Konner Macias</h4>
      <p class="modal-text">I’m a third year Mathematics of Computer major and a Statistics minor at UCLA. I’m from the Sacramento Area and have grown up with sports my whole life. I mainly played junior competitive tennis and got good enough to receive some DII scholarships, but school will always come first! I am now the Team Captain of UCLA’s Competitive Club Tennis Team, and with a love for data science, I decided to combine my passions by creating Bruin Sports Analytics! If you see me around town, please make sure to say hi!</p>

          <h4>Akram Almohalwas</h4>
          <p class="modal-text">My name is Akram Almohalwas, I've been a lecturer at the statistics department at UCLA since 2010. I got promoted to a continuing lecturer last year. I had my PhD in mathematics with statistics concentration from Central Michigan University. I initially worked on data mining techniques applied on gene expression data while working on my PhD dissertation. I always loved sports and following different kind of sports, especially Tennis and Basketball. I thought that using my statistical knowledge and my love for the sport I've decided to help undergraduate student to conduct little research using NBA data. Students usually are asked to read some literature regarding data mining and NBA data related research. I usually provide the research ideas to students and guide them through the research process. I get the pleasure of witnessing the AHA moments when students statistics knowledge is put to use in real world applications. I'm happy to give my students the research experience regardless how little it can be.</p>

Also, I've engaged in sports my entire life; some of my favorites to play are water polo, racquetball, and golf. In addition, I follow football, basketball, hockey, soccer, and baseball, so I would love to become a data scientist in the sports world one day.</p>
