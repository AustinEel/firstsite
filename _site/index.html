                      <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/relievMLB/pic1.jpg" alt="cover photo"></center><p>In Major League Baseball (MLB), a reliever is defined as any pitcher who is substituted for a starting pitcher to help finish a game. Ideally, even as of a few years ago, relievers were meant to be brought in after the starter had pitched at least 6 or more innings. However, as the game has evolved, relievers have expanded their respective roles. For instance, teams like the Tampa Bay Rays have implemented relievers in a starting role, where the relievers are known as "openers." Starters, who used to go much deeper in the game, are being pulled in the 5th inning--sometimes earlier--more often than ever. After all, starters are limited to a certain number of pitches, meaning that you'll rarely see pitchers venture into triple-digit pitch counts to prevent injuries that may require Tommy John surgery. Consequently, relievers are being used more often and for longer periods of time. But, the volatility amongst MLB relievers hasn't gone away, which means consistency might be hard to find in a reliever. This variability brings about an important question for MLB front offices&#58; is it worth paying extra for free agent relievers in today's game? Through an examination of past and present player salaries and performance, I will try to see whether inflated salaries for relievers are really worth it.</p>

Each year, the highest ranked teams from all European leagues automatically qualify or enter the preliminary stages of this tournament. In the end, 32 teams participate in a grueling group stage, where every team plays each other twice. The top two teams from all 8 groups make the first knockout stage. Each knockout matchup has two games, other than the final which has one. As a result, the UCL format generally ensures that the team who wins must consistently play well.</p>

After missing the playoffs for blank consecutive years, the Lakers look to make a playoff run and possibly contend for a championship title with the addition of the NBA's most prominent star. In addition to Lebron James, the Lakers added notable veterans such as Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Lance Stephenson. However, the Lakers remain at their core a very young team, with blossoming players with high potentials.</p>

Fans young and old crowd around laptops and televisions, host watch parties with friends, and some even witness the magic in person if lucky enough. From watching new upcomers like Denis Shapovalov and Borna Coric, to legends such as Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, each match is always fun to watch. Of course, just like with every other sport, debating and betting about who will win each match in casual settings as well as in fantasy draws is a crucial part of the entire experience.</p>

After taking nearly half of the season to earn the starting job, his performance caused major concern for the future. As noted in a May 2017 Rotoworld article, Goff's rookie season was historically bad&#58; "Of the 49 rookie quarterbacks to make at least seven starts since 2000, Goff posted the fourth-lowest touchdown total (five), sixth-lowest YPA (5.31), 15th-worst QB rating (63.6) and 22nd-worst completion percentage (54.6)." Coming into the 2017 NFL football season, some even postulated that new coach Sean McVay might select QB Sean Mannion to lead the team.</p>

The award, which recognizes the best male footballer in the world, has been around for a while now.  In fact, this will be the 53rd time that it will be awarded. Every year, the speculation around who the eventual winner will be creates a ton of buzz, and this year is no different. Before we join in on that hype train, let's take a look at how the "Golden Ball" has exchanged hands over the last of couple of years.</p>
