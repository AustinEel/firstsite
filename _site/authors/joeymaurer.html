			<b><h5>About: </h5></b>
			<p class="module-text">
			I am a second year Statistics major from Temecula, CA. I grew up playing and watching hockey; my favorite team is the San Jose Sharks. I also enjoy most of the other major sports, as well as college soccer and gymnastics. My additional hobbies include astronomy, SCUBA diving, and fish/reptile breeding. I hope to pursue a career in biostatistics or sports analytics, and am thrilled to be at a school like UCLA that is a powerhouse in academics and athletics.

			<h2><a href="/vegasGK">Vegas Golden Knights: The Most Successful Expansion Team in NHL History</a></h2>
            <h6><em>08 Jun 2018</em></h6> 
            <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/vegas/cover.jpg" alt="golden knights"></center><figcaption>The Associated Press</figcaption><p>This wasn’t supposed to happen. The first major professional sports team to ever grace the city of Las Vegas wasn’t supposed to be this good. Hockey wasn’t meant to be played in the desert. A team full of disposable parts and cast-offs wasn’t supposed to mesh this well together. It must be a fluke.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="/kenDerby">Kentucky Derby 2018: History, Trends, and Predictions</a></h2>
            <h6><em>01 May 2018</em></h6> 
            <img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/kent/cover.jpg" alt="Horses Charging"></center><p>Described as “The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports”, the Kentucky Derby never fails to capture the attention of sports and gambling enthusiasts alike each May. First held in 1875, the world famous race at Churchill Downs has become ingrained in American sports culture. Thoroughbreds that have gone on to become immortalized in history used the Derby as a stepping stone to greatness. The 144th Kentucky Derby will take place on Saturday, May 5.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="/uclaGym">UCLA Gymnastics: Analysis and Optimal Lineups Heading into Championship Meets</a></h2>
            <h6><em>22 Mar 2018</em></h6> 
            <img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/gymnastics/cover.jpg" alt="UCLA Gymnastics girl"></center><p>The most exciting time of the year for women’s collegiate gymnastics is just around the corner. UCLA, currently ranked 3rd in the country, will compete for a conference, regional, and hopefully national championship in the coming weeks. Boasting a roster littered with former Olympians and elite gymnasts, the Bruins are in a great position to challenge Oklahoma, LSU, and the rest of the best programs in America for a NCAA title.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="/joeThornton">Joe Thornton: The Bearded Legend</a></h2>
            <h6><em>27 Feb 2018</em></h6> 
            <img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/thornton/cover_1.jpg" alt="Bearded Hockey Player"></center><p>Throughout his 20 years in the National Hockey League (NHL), Joe Thornton has proven time and time again that he is one of hockey’s best players. Drafted first overall in the 1997 NHL Draft by the Boston Bruins, Thornton was highly-touted, but nobody thought he would turn out to be such a legendary player. With a large frame and an insane ability to distribute the puck to his teammates, he has been and continues to be remarkably consistent. As a result, he has won numerous awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (League MVP), the Art Ross Trophy (Most Points), 6 All-Star Team nominations, and a gold medal at the 2010 Olympics with Team Canada.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="/wsoccer18">An In-Depth Look at NCAA Pac-12 Women’s Soccer</a></h2>
            <h6><em>13 Jan 2018</em></h6> 
            <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets//wsoccer18/soccer.png" alt="UCLA Women's Soccer"></center><p>Women’s collegiate soccer is thriving on the west coast. Less than two months ago, the championship game of the College Cup saw two Pac-12 powerhouses go head-to-head in Orlando, Florida. Stanford emerged with a 3-2 victory over UCLA to secure their second title since 2011 and the conference’s fourth in that seven-year span. Both teams are set up extremely well heading into next season, and the road to a national championship appears to run through California. </p>
