			<h2><a href="/zverevGS">Why Has Alexander Zverev Failed to Deliver at Grand Slams?</a></h2>
            <h6><em>09 May 2018</em></h6> 
            <img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/zverev/cover.png" alt="zverev backhand"></center><figcaption></figcaption><p>Since 2004, the ATP “World Number 1” ranking in tennis has been controlled by four men. In fact, no one else has been able to even enter the top 2 over the last decade and a half. But all good things must come to an end. The Big Four are not getting any younger, and they cannot sustain this era of unparalleled dominance forever. So what’s next for men’s tennis? Who will take up the mantle of world number 1 after Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray can no longer play as they have? Look no further than Alexander “Sascha” Zverev Jr, the 21 year old German youngster who took the tennis world by storm this past year. Of all of the “Next Gen” players on tour, Zverev has made the most progress as he is currently ranked number 3 in the world. In 2017, at just 20 years old, he legitimized his potential for greatness when he finished the year at world number 4. Along the way, he captured 5 singles titles overall, including 2 Masters 1000 titles over Djokovic and Federer in each final, respectively.</p>
			
			<h2><a href="/cristiano">An In-Depth Analysis of Cristiano Ronaldo</a></h2>
            <h6><em>08 Mar 2018</em></h6> 
            <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/cristiano/ronaldo1.png" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo"></center><p>One of the greatest players of this generation, Portuguese and Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo has been the topic of discussion among football pundits. The five time Ballon d’or winner has been struggling in the 2017-18 season to replicate his incredible goal scoring performances from previous seasons. With its star player facing a slump, Real Madrid is also going through a rough patch this season, currently sitting in 3rd place, 15 points off the current leader, Barcelona. As things stand, Real Madrid could be facing its worst finish in a long time, having finished outside the top 2 only once in the last 10 years. </p>
			
			<h2><a href="/wawrinka">An In-Depth Analysis of Stan Wawrinka</a></h2>
            <h6><em>27 Jan 2018</em></h6> 
            <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/stananalysis/wawrinka.png" alt="Stan Wawrinka"></center><p>In the era of the Big Four, tennis has seldom seen a Grand Slam Championship claimed by a player not named Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, or Rafael Nadal. The Big Four have won 50 of the last 58 Grand Slam tournaments, dating back to the 2003 Wimbledon. Ever since then, the spotlight in men’s tennis has only shifted between these four champions. With a combined career record of 3443-782 (81.5%) and a combined total of $377,087,356 in prize money, the Big Four have dominated tennis in a way never before seen in the sport. However, despite such dominance, it may be time to start considering that world tennis may really have a Big Five.</p>
