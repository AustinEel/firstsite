After taking nearly half of the season to earn the starting job, his performance caused major concern for the future. As noted in a May 2017 Rotoworld article, Goff's rookie season was historically bad&#58; "Of the 49 rookie quarterbacks to make at least seven starts since 2000, Goff posted the fourth-lowest touchdown total (five), sixth-lowest YPA (5.31), 15th-worst QB rating (63.6) and 22nd-worst completion percentage (54.6)." Coming into the 2017 NFL football season, some even postulated that new coach Sean McVay might select QB Sean Mannion to lead the team.</p>

The award, which recognizes the best male footballer in the world, has been around for a while now.  In fact, this will be the 53rd time that it will be awarded. Every year, the speculation around who the eventual winner will be creates a ton of buzz, and this year is no different.

                      <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/nhlCon/pic_1.jpeg" alt="cover photo"></center><p>It's no secret that William Nylander has held out on signing a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. As a restricted free agent about to enter into his first non-entry level NHL contract, Nylander is very limited in his options, sign with the Leafs, or don't play at all. Players rarely choose not to play at all, with many top six players opting for bridge deals - three-to-four year contracts typically valued far less than they wish in exchange for an opportunity to prove themselves more capable of a future contract more extensive in both term and salary. It is also common for players to begin negotiations asking for high pay, only to settle for what they were actually hoping for. What makes Nylander's situation unique isn't that he reportedly asked for upward of $8 million per year (money typically reserved for roughly top two talent on a team), but that he has not since backed down and signed for less. Against everyone's expectations, it is now late November, the Leafs have played over a quarter of the season, and they are still without the 22 year old Swede.</p>

In addition to that, the basic rules of the sport are mind-numbingly simple to understand - the best of three attempts at each lift are added together to form a total, which is then compared among competitors in the same weight class. In the right moments, the battle to become the strongest lifter can play out in dramatic conditions, such as John Haack's 315kg (694lb) pull at 83kg (183lb) to secure the IPF World Classic Powerlifting Championships title.</p>

The man from Kazakhstan known around the world today as 'GGG' did not have traction in the popularity department for a massive portion of his fighting career. After an incredible amatuer career of 350 fights, Gennady Golovkin's professional career stalled for years due to promotional issues. In 2012, already 30 years of age, Golovkin finally decided to take his career to the United States under a new promoter. At the time, his record was 23-0 with 20 knockouts and he was already the WBA Middleweight Champion. Because of his dangerous record and lack of popularity, the top fighters in the division heavily avoided him for years.</p>

                      <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/oakland/cover.jpeg" alt="A's teammates"></center><figcaption><i>The Mercury News</i>; from L to R, Matt Chapman, Matt Olson, and Marcus Semien</figcaption><p>At the beginning of the 2018 MLB season, many experts thought the Oakland Athletics would once again sport one of the worst records in baseball. According to Baseball Prospectus, the Athletics were projected to have a 76-86 record this year, which would be a miniscule improvement from their 75-87 record last year. The oddsmakers at Bovada had even lower expectations for the squad, as the over/under for their win total was set at 74.5. Given that the team has been in the American League West cellar for three years straight, even the most optimistic A’s fans had to acknowledge that a playoff appearance might not be in order for at least a couple of years. So, you can’t really blame all the people who slept on the A’s going into the season, especially since Oakland didn’t do much over the offseason to improve themselves. But, the A’s have given their fans some hope with their impressive start to the season; after the first 54 games of the campaign, Oakland stands at 28-26, good for a .519 win percentage. People around the game might be surprised at this kind of run, but when looking at the roster makeup and the major statistics on both sides of the ball, one can better understand why the A’s are experiencing this kind of success.</p>
