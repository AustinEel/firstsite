&lt;p&gt;It is true that a goalkeeper's main job is to keep the ball out of the net. However, in the modern game, where margins are much tighter and errors are easily punished, it is a valuable advantage for a goalkeeper to be an adept passer of the ball. This is particularly useful when a team plays a style with the intent of creating spaces to attack by drawing the opposition to press high, such as the style employed (with success, in the past with Napoli) by Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri. It is no coincidence, either, to see big clubs spending record sums of money on goalkeepers these days, goalkeepers that are not just shot-stoppers, but also excellent footballers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pssPXUABhb8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Napoli playing out from the back to create one-on-ones higher up the field. Note how deep Napoli's center-backs are in the build-up and how the goalkeeper Pepe Reina shows composure under pressure to pass the ball instead of simply lumping it upfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's more than just the goalkeeper&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we thought it might be handy to develop a tool that determines how good of a footballer a goalkeeper is. It is too simplistic to say that goalkeepers with better passing success rates are better at passing than those with lower rates. This is because of two reasons: firstly, there are lots of other factors at play such as the play style of the team (building out from the back vs direct play), quality of the opponents in pressing high up the pitch, the starting formation of the team (for example, 3-5-2 vs 4-4-2 vs 4-3-3) among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the success rate of a pass depends on multiple factors- the ability of the passer, the awareness of the receiver to adjust his angle and body shape to receive the pass and the general positioning of the team. In addition, the completion of a pass per se cannot classify it as a 'good' pass. For example, the weight of the pass from the passer could be too weak or too strong, which would not allow the receiver to take a good touch and could lead to loss of possession. One possible way of accounting for this would be to determine how many passes were completed after the first pass and weighting subsequent passes accordingly. However, the issue with this is that a loss of possession in turn could be due to a bad decision of the passer or a mistake by the receiver or neither- in the case of very good pressing or a poor structure of positional play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clip below taken from a match between Liverpool and Leicester City in 2017 shows one example of poor positional play and spatial awareness. When the ball is played from the goalkeeper to the defender, the defender has no real options for a pass except for a pass back to his own goalkeeper. He instead takes the risk to pass it forward, expecting his midfielder to move into the space. However, the midfielder is too late to arrive, allowing Leicester City to capitalize and score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/4SZHv7FsDRKhNo3tX0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/4SZHv7FsDRKhNo3tX0&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool we propose takes the aforementioned factors into account and attempts to remove any bias that may occur as a result of those factors. This is a challenge because soccer, more so than other sports, is a chain of events, with decisions often being made based on the game state. For example, a team leading 1-0 in the 85th minute of a game is likely to play less expansively than if the same team were winning 3-0 at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often forgotten is the fact that in sport, we are dealing with human beings and not machines. Like most human beings, players are prone to dips in confidence when things go against them. It is often seen that when teams are on a losing streak, they tend to play more conservatively. Likewise, when teams are on a winning streak, not only do they take more risks, but their passing also becomes quicker and sharper. In our opinion, our tool should reward those players that maintain a consistent level of passing, regardless of how the team as a whole performs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's have a closer look at how the formation of a team can affect the passing options a GK has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/pass/image2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;StatsBomb&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a simple example, the picture above (courtesy of StatsBomb) shows how the passing options a goalkeeper has is determined by the starting formation of the team. In this particular match, Leicester City played in a 4-2-3-1 starting formation, while Wolverhampton Wanderers played in a 3-4-1-2 starting formation. We see that Kasper Schmeichel, the Leicester goalkeeper, played more passes to his wing-backs and towards his striker Jamie Vardy. Meanwhile, Rui Patricio, the Wolves goalkeeper, played almost all his passes to his three center-backs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the use of the word 'starting' formation. This is because teams often change formation during games in order to adapt to various scenarios. Moreover, in the modern game, team shape is fluid and constantly changing- for example, a team could start with a 4-3-3 formation but defend in a 4-4-2 formation instead to give the full-backs more protection. The example below (courtesy of Opta) from a match between Liverpool and Manchester City in 2017 shows Liverpool changing formation from a 4-3-3 to 3-4-2 after Sadio Mane was sent off. Once again, we see a similar difference in passing networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/pass/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the case of Arsenal (who played 33% of their games this season with 3-4-3) was considered, a similar pattern was found wherein the passing networks (too messy to show here!) showed thicker lines from the goalkeeper to the center-backs when a 3-4-3 formation was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we take a look at 'distance and direction' of a pass. Most sources of statistics only differentiate between 'short' and ''long' passes. However, our research shows that pass accuracy fluctuates widely based on direction as well. This also has to do with the fact that some goalkeepers in the league are naturally right-footed, while others are left-footed. Moreover, some goalkeepers, such as Alisson, prefer to throw the ball out more, whereas others such as Kepa, prefer to use their feet. To make a distinction, we decided to split the pitch into 8 different zones, as demarcated by the red lines shown below. Passing networks are then looked at on a game-by-game basis to determine the 'weaker' side and passes into each of these 8 zones are weighted accordingly, from most difficult (wide-high-center) to least difficult (own-low-center).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/pass/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Issues and Future Plans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the issues we faced was the lack of available data. While commonly used metrics such as passing percentages and starting formations are readily available, others such as ways to measure 'pressure' or speed of distribution are not. (We note here that more extensive data is available solely for the FIFA World Cup 2018. However, we decided against using our model for the World Cup since it is well accepted within the football community that teams in an international tournament do not have as developed of a style of play compared to club teams due to lack of preparation time. Moreover, the sample size of games is extremely small.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as the picture below shows, most sources of data do not differentiate between passes that are intended towards a specific player and hopeful punts up the pitch. This meant that we had to review video footage of games in order to determine these ourselves. Fortunately, the StatsZone app provides a slider which lets us determine each minute a goalkeeper passed the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/pass/image5.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following examples will illustrate the difficulty of distinguishing between a pass and a punt just from numbers. In this clip taken from a match between Huddersfield Town and Manchester City in 2018, we see that all Manchester City players, except for the striker, Sergio Aguero are either being man-marked or put under pressure. Ederson, the goalkeeper, then thinks quickly plays a pass specifically intended for Aguero, who then scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/4YY9flqqBwhBf4i5NZ&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/4YY9flqqBwhBf4i5NZ&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clip, taken from a match between West Ham United and Burnley, shows an example of a hopeful punt upfield from Joe Hart, as he is being put under pressure by a Burnley attacker. Hart gets given the assist, but it is fair to say that he did not really mean it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/fejrDebQuLKE25rlw6&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/fejrDebQuLKE25rlw6&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us solve this (and other issues), we developed a little app using R Shiny (screenshot below). Punts and passes are color-coded differently, but both are retained since we would like to use 'punts up the pitch' to help us determine the goalkeeper best suited to a 'long-ball team'. The tool also helps us categorize passes by zones of the pitch that they are played into, as described earlier and calculates a metric weighted based on the difficulty of a pass into a particular zone and the opponent/playing style being used. At present, the weights we have chosen are somewhat arbitrary. However, in the future, we plan to come up with an unbiased overall metric for goalkeeper distribution based on empirical weights. More on this will be described in a blog-post that will be published in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sources and Credits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to credit a number of sources. StatsBomb, Stats Zone and Opta were used for passing networks and visualizations. The mock pitch tool was inspired by Ben Torvaney's 'soccer event tracker'. Full match videos from the 2016-17 soccer season onwards (this would probably interest a lot of people!) were found on fullmatchsports.com/fullmatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the effects of a major knee surgery suffered during a September 2016 matchup vs. the &lt;i&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/i&gt;, and a reinjury that was followed by a second surgery in April of 2017, the 2018 season came and went with Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia compiling thirteen total plate appearances; he accumulated just a single hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Boston Red Sox went on to capture their 9th World Series Championship, the team's first since 2013 and 4th since 2000, they had to do so without contributions from the 2007 American League Rookie of the Year and 2008 AL MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team's journey through the playoffs this past season featured series wins against the 100-win Yankees 3-1, the 103-win Astros 4-1, and the NL Champion, 92-win Dodgers 4-1. The team, without Pedroia in the lineup, had to instead rely on a platoon at second base that featured utility man Brock Holt, natural third baseman Eduardo Nunez and 36-year old midseason acquisition Ian Kinsler (who, as of December 14th, 2018, is no longer on the team).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedroia, the face of Boston's franchise until the arrival of 2018 MVP Mookie Betts, is locked up under contact until 2022. Signing for 8 years, $110 Million during the summer of 2013, even Pedroia indicated a sense of uncertainty about his longevity to reporters, stating &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/redsox/2013/07/24/red-sox-dustin-pedroia-finalize-110m-8-year-deal/2583911/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1548303230749000&quot;&gt;I don't know if I'll be done by then, man&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a league where the average age of a player on a given team lands between a minimum of 26.2 (Chicago White Sox) and a maximum of 30.3 (Toronto Blue Jays), the Red Sox must decide whether to implement the 35-year old Pedroia immediately into the starting lineup as the everyday second baseman for 2019, or stick with the Brock Holt (30yrs)/Eduardo Nunez (31yrs) platoon at the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2018/06/07/dustin-pedroia-injury-red-sox-future&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1548303230750000&quot;&gt;The Boston Herald's Jason Mastrodonato reports that there exists just six full-time position players 35 or older in the major leagues this past year -- of which five are designated hitters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In complying with this statistic, it would certainly be easy for the Red Sox to maintain the playoff platoon, or turn to a younger substitute in the form of Michael Chavis (23), Marco Hernandez (26) or Tzu-Wei Lin (24). With that being said, it will be difficult for the club to sit Pedroia on a regular basis as a result of his previous success in the league, his leadership value, and the fact that the team still owes him roughly 40 million dollars on his current deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Red Sox games throughout the years, Dustin Pedroia can be seen taking the first pitch of many at-bats, even though the offering will often come directly down the heart of the plate. In contrast to pitches later in his at-bats, Pedroia acts generally unprepared for the first delivery, doing minimal set-up before the pitch is fired, as if he has no intention to swing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7TbWAOhZXo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As our research indicates, there may exist a different offensive approach that can keep Pedroia relevant in the Red Sox lineup by boosting his productivity at the plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below we have two graphs: one showing Pedroia's year by year Offensive Wins above Replacement and the other Pedroia's Pitches seen Per Plate Appearance average (P/PA) for each season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/pitch_off/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/pitch_off/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking in depth at the statistical side of Pedroia's production, it became noticeable that some sort of trend exists between an increasing average of Pitches Seen per Plate Appearance and a decreasing yearly Offensive Wins Over Replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then conducted a significance test, comparing Pedroia's &lt;b&gt;P/PA&lt;/b&gt; during his &lt;b&gt;2008 MVP season&lt;/b&gt; (in which he saw his 2nd highest oWAR and his lowest P/PA) to his &lt;b&gt;average career P/PA&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The t-test, satisfying all conditions of normality, independence, and randomization, indicated a low enough p-value, and therefore established a significant difference in Dustin Pedroia's plate approach in his 2008 MVP season compared to the rest of his career as a whole. This suggests an explanation for the differences seen in production levels year-to-year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further evidence into the relationship, we developed a line graph comparing the two variables to each other, placing oWAR on the y-axis, and P/PA on the x-axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of a line of best fit produced the following graph:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/pitch_off/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not a perfectly negative correlation, the slope of -1.45 and R-squared value of 0.017 indicate that P/PA is a factor that impacts oWAR, but is not the &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; influencer that determines Pedroia's offensive production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is evidenced through the t-test and analytical graphs, Dustin Pedroia has often experienced more success when he sees less pitches per each individual plate appearance. We equate the term &quot;success&quot; numerically with the value of oWAR in order to develop a clear understanding of his offensive productivity and results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAR is the value (in wins) lost by a team if a player gets injured, and thus replaced, in a given season. The point of WAR isn't meant to be an exact measure, but rather an estimate of a particular player's value to their team. Below are the attached equations that are used to calculate both a player's total WAR and their oWAR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;WAR = (Batting Runs + Baserunning Runs + &lt;b&gt;Fielding Runs&lt;/b&gt; + Positional Adjustment + League Adjustment +Replacement Runs) / (Runs Per Win)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;oWAR= (Batting Runs + Baserunning Runs + Positional Adjustment + League Adjustment +Replacement Runs) / (Runs Per Win)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is shown by the bold term, the lone difference between WAR and oWAR is that oWAR does not include the amount of fielding runs that the player has saved/contributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of Pedroia's increased success at the plate with a decreased number of pitches seen, it would be advantageous to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;move Pedroia down towards the bottom of the order&lt;/span&gt;, but still &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;keep him in the everyday lineup&lt;/span&gt;. In reference to his positioning in the batting order, often times, the role of batters at the top of the order is to tire out the starting pitcher by seeing more pitches. For the Red Sox to maximize both team success and individual success, an ideal spot for Pedroia to bat in the batting order would be the &lt;i&gt;7th spot&lt;/i&gt;. The 7th position, taken up by hitters such as Jason Kipnis (CLE), Dexter Fowler (STL), and Daniel Murphy (WSH/CHC) is often given to older, yet still impactful players, who hit mostly for contact at this point in their careers. This spot in the order would allow Pedroia to be more aggressive early in the count, giving him a better chance to make a difference when provided with everyday playing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Red Sox Manager Alex Cora should be careful about his usage of Pedroia at second base on a regular basis. Instead, using Pedroia in the DH spot semi-regularly will maximize his chances to produce offensively without wearing him down, a beneficial move with respect to his injury-filled past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pedroia's production at second base, indicated by his dWAR (Defensive Wins Above Replacement) seemingly peaked in the 2014 season, when it maxed out at a career high of 2.5 and won him his 3rd Gold Glove Award. Since then, in seasons in which he has eclipsed 90 games, he has posted dWAR's of 0.0, 1.8 and 0.1. His diminishing value at second base shows that the Red Sox would not be taking a serious hit by playing a replacement once or twice in a given series, and would, by placing him in the DH spot, retain his health for both when he does play second, and for his frequent plate appearances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, seeing less pitches in each at bat will also limit Pedroia's opportunity for injury at the plate (less pitches seen, less chance to get HBP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dustin Pedroia, still an offensive weapon for the Boston Red Sox should be provided regular playing time, whether at DH or at second base, for seasons to come. With his playing time, Pedroia should make an effort to restore his approach highlighted during his 2008 MVP year, as an aggressive hitter early in the count.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Max Blane</name></author><summary type="html">Due to the effects of a major knee surgery suffered during a September 2016 matchup vs. the Toronto Blue Jays, and a reinjury that was followed by a second surgery in April of 2017, the 2018 season came and went with Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia compiling thirteen total plate appearances; he accumulated just a single hit.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Constructing My All-Time NBA Lineup Through K-Means Clustering, Part 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/nbaclust2" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Constructing My All-Time NBA Lineup Through K-Means Clustering, Part 2" /><published>2019-01-15T10:57:31-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-15T10:57:31-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/nbaclust2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/nbaclust2">&lt;style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you haven't read my first article on the topic, check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/kmeansallnba&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749397000&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I wrote an article where I used k-means clustering to help choose five NBA players from 1980 to the present to constitute an all-time starting lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, the feedback was great, and people were able to understand the process I went through to choose my starting 5. However, I also got some negative feedback, and would like to address some of that here. While I received the typical &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a1xzs1/bruin_sports_analytics_constructing_my_alltime/eatn2go&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749398000&quot;&gt;lol Draymond&lt;/a&gt;&quot; comments, I also got some constructive criticism on my methodology that certainly calls for response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a few comments on how my lineup does not factor in era strength. While it is true that the strength of competition vastly varies throughout different eras, I would like to think that by only using All-Stars from the 1979-80 era to the present, I eliminate a good deal of the confoundment across eras. Though some mid-to-lower tier players might have had more success if they played in a different decade (e.g., Jahlil Okafor), I am of the opinion that elite players are elite, regardless of the era they play in. To say that my lineup of Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Draymond Green and Shaquille O'Neal would get &quot;rekt&quot; because era strength was not considered is, frankly, a bit unreasonable. I understand that a lot of those older players played in a time where the league was just not as talented, fast, etc., but saying players like Magic and Jordan would not be as good had they played today completely ignores the superior skill, talent and work ethic these players possessed that made them the legends that they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, some negatively reacted to my use of advanced stats, since &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a1xzs1/bruin_sports_analytics_constructing_my_alltime/eatryyf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749400000&quot;&gt;it's easy to play to maximize an analytic after it is created&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, and thus invalidating the use of advanced analytics on players from different periods of the game. However, if we look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749400000&quot;&gt;how some of these advanced statistics are calculated&lt;/a&gt;, it is clear that players and data from all eras are carefully considered when regressing various statistics to produce the target advanced statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, let's look at some of the top 10 players in my dataset for some popular advanced statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Win Shares:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nbaclust2/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value Over Replacement Player:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nbaclust2/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offensive Box Plus-Minus:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nbaclust2/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defensive Box Plus-Minus:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nbaclust2/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is not the most precise way to show this, we can see that for many of the popular advanced metrics, there is a decent amount of variation in players from different time periods when focusing on the cream of the crop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a broad sense, I feel that the disagreements here are a matter of individual perspective on whether it is fair to compare statistics over time despite disparities in league strength and playing style. While I generally agree that many of these statistics confound due to time, I think that the structure of my project mitigates that enough to still be considered valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to switch gears to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a1xzs1/bruin_sports_analytics_constructing_my_alltime/eatryyf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749405000&quot;&gt;suggestions&lt;/a&gt; I got about finding more statistical ways to choose players from the clusters. I will admit that I could have at least considered some more math-y methods, even if I still ended up choosing players I saw fit for an all-time lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my original article, I did list players that were closest to the centroid in each cluster; we can consider players from this group in a possible lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used a random forest method to tease out important features that distinguished players in each cluster from players in the entire dataset. For reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further investigate, I carried out a method recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/so-you-have-some-clusters-now-what-abfd297a575b&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749406000&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; to extract feature importance in clusters. First, I constructed a random forest model that predicted the probability of every player belonging to the 7th cluster. Then, using a built-in function in the randomForest library in R, I saw which variables were most important in construction of the model. This showed me that in determining whether a player was in the 7th cluster or not, the two most important variables were 2 Pointers Attempted Per Game and 3-Point Attempt Rate (percentage of field goal attempts that were 3-pointers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what the plot that shows variable importance in the randomForest library looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nbaclust2/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 5&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To approach lineup construction in a more scientific method, I decided to perform this random forest process on each cluster, then arrange the players in each cluster in descending order of their most important feature, and finally, pick the player with the highest value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the closest-to-centroid and random forest methods, these are the players we end up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nbaclust2/pic6.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 6&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be blunt, these groups of players do not stack up to the starting five that I assembled. However, lineups created from both collectives would be incredibly fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Closest-to-Centroid group, I would probably pick Marques Johnson, Chris Mullin, Peja Stojakovic, Charles Barkley and Chris Bosh. This would be an electrifying lineup; we would have the first ever point-forward (and fellow Bruin) in Johnson running the show, two elite sharpshooters on the wing in Mullin and Stojakovic, one of the greatest and most uniquely talented players of all time in Barkley at the 4 and an underrated, elite defensive big who could stretch the floor and occasionally make a nifty move in the post in late-career (*sad react*) Bosh. This team would also have a distinctive defensive identity, as the shortest player here is Barkley at 6'6&quot;. Unfortunately, Mullin and Stojakovic would almost certainly have trouble defending on the wing; despite their size and length, neither were known as the most lockdown guys in their days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Random Forest group, I would pick out Steph Curry, Derrick Rose, George Gervin, Shawn Marion and Hakeem Olajuwon. On the offensive end, this lineup would be so ridiculously entertaining to watch. At the guard slots, we would have the greatest shooter to ever grace basketball in Curry and one of the quickest, most explosive athletes to play in the NBA in Rose (ignoring injuries *sad react*). The wings would consist of the smoothest scorer out there in The Iceman and the amazingly athletic Marion, who would compete with Curry on this team for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-H0EjcoMZRk&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749420000&quot;&gt;prettiest jump-shot&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, lurking in the paint, we have the crown jewel of this team: Hakeem Olajuwon. As arguably the greatest center in NBA history, Hakeem would make defenders look &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DhW4uXlRGAF0&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749420000&quot;&gt;silly&lt;/a&gt; with his silky post-moves on a nightly basis. While this team would be absolutely unstoppable on the offensive end, they would certainly struggle on defense. Despite having the all-time leader in blocks manning the paint (Olajuwon) and a marvelous, versatile defender available to switch on whomever (Marion), this lineup has a pretty subpar defender on the wing in Gervin. And as for the guards, we might as well put turnstiles on the perimeter if our options out there are Curry and Rose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, mostly for defensive reasons, I would still choose my lineup of Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Draymond Green and Shaquille O'Neal over these more scientifically chosen lineups. Regardless, these lineups were important exercises to consider, and definitely added a bit more of a statistical element to my decision, as they gave me perspective on two numerically defined alternatives to my initial choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is likely the end of my work on this project, unless I come back a few months later with a random revelation, or decide to respond to a few more Reddit comments. Thank you for indulging me in this long, arduous, basketball-y journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, who is scoring on my team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my code, you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/nikhil348/K-Means-Article&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1547585749422000&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nikhil Sharma</name></author><summary type="html">A few months ago, I wrote an article where I used k-means clustering to help choose five NBA players from 1980 to the present to constitute an all-time starting lineup.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Relievers in Today’s MLB</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/relieversTodaysMLB" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Relievers in Today's MLB" /><published>2018-12-05T09:24:39-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-05T09:24:39-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/relieversTodaysMLB</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/relieversTodaysMLB">&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/relievMLB/pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cover photo&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Major League Baseball (MLB), a reliever is defined as any pitcher who is substituted for a starting pitcher to help finish a game. Ideally, even as of a few years ago, relievers were meant to be brought in after the starter had pitched at least 6 or more innings. However, as the game has evolved, relievers have expanded their respective roles. For instance, teams like the Tampa Bay Rays have implemented relievers in a starting role, where the relievers are known as &quot;openers.&quot; Starters, who used to go much deeper in the game, are being pulled in the 5th inning--sometimes earlier--more often than ever. After all, starters are limited to a certain number of pitches, meaning that you'll rarely see pitchers venture into triple-digit pitch counts to prevent injuries that may require Tommy John surgery. Consequently, relievers are being used more often and for longer periods of time. But, the volatility amongst MLB relievers hasn't gone away, which means consistency might be hard to find in a reliever. This variability brings about an important question for MLB front offices: is it worth paying extra for free agent relievers in today's game? Through an examination of past and present player salaries and performance, I will try to see whether inflated salaries for relievers are really worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it frankly, relievers are receiving all-time high salaries. Front offices are willing to spend top dollar on the best arms available, even if this strategy might be a risky proposition. One good example is how the Colorado Rockies spent over $100 million on just their relievers over the 2018 offseason. That was more than twice the amount they spent on starters! In fact, the Rockies were 1 of 7 MLB franchises to commit more money to their bullpen than their starting pitchers this past offseason. To further demonstrate the increasing value of relievers, I looked at top reliever salaries from the 2011 and 2018 MLB seasons on Spotrac.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/relievMLB/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/relievMLB/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we see that the top relievers of 2018 received much more money than their counterparts from 2011. For instance, Aroldis Chapman and Kenley Jansen both earned upwards of $80 million contracts in 2018, while the top breadwinner from 2011, Jake Peavy, earned a mere $52 million contract, even though he also started a fair share of games. Moreover, David Robertson, who earned the 5th-most money of 2018 relievers, equaled the earnings of the 3rd highest-paid 2011 reliever, Francisco Cordero. And if we take into account the context of some of these contracts, the results might even be more revealing. After all, David Robertson isn't even an elite reliever on his own team, as the Yankees arguably have better relievers in Aroldis Chapman, Dellin Betances, and Chad Green, among others. On the other hand, all five names listed from the 2011 season were all top dogs in their respective bullpens. This example gives average fans a better idea of just how drastically reliever salaries have shifted upwards over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to account for the spike in reliever salaries has been their increased usage in games throughout the league. Based on data from fangraphs.com, I created visualizations of total reliever innings pitched and wins from the years 2008-2018 to demonstrate the uptick in reliever usage recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/relievMLB/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008, relievers completed just over 15,000 cumulative innings, which was still a lot for that era in baseball. Just look at the 2009 to 2014 seasons, where the cumulative innings pitched by relievers didn't even match the 2008 campaign. However, the most recent four seasons all had dramatic upticks in innings pitched for relievers league-wide. As a result, in the 2018 season, relievers nearly posted a whopping 17,500 innings, which is over 2,000 innings more than in 2008. Correspondingly, we saw many of the same trends with reliever wins. First of all, there was a bit of a lull in wins earned from 2008 all the way up to 2014. However, from 2015 to 2018, there has been a gradual increase in reliever wins. In fact, the ascent from 2017 to 2018 is extremely relevant; after a slight dip from 2016 to 2017, the 2018 season had over 100 more reliever wins than the previous campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though reliever usage has definitely increased in recent times, relievers are still extremely volatile. To examine this assumption, I took a look at the 2008 and 2018 seasons for reliever data on fangraphs.com; specifically, I examined earned run averages (ERAs), which are a measure of how effective a pitcher is during his time in games. Since the goal of a pitcher is to allow as few runs as possible, low ERAs are indicative of good pitching. High ERAs, on the other hand, show that the pitcher is rather ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/relievMLB/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make these scatterplots, I first filtered each season's set of relievers by only including those who have pitched at least 60 innings. This still gives a relatively large pool of relievers, but it doesn't have an excessive amount of guys. Then, I plotted with the x-axis being ERA and the y-axis being IP to find the spreads of ERAs and correlations between ERA and IP for both seasons. For the 2008 season, there were 92 qualifying relievers with 60+IP, yet none of them exceeded 90 IP. The ERAs ranged from 1.33 all the way up to 6.08, but the median ERA was 3.515. The standard deviation of the 2008 ERAs was 1.09, which is pretty high given the relatively low median ERA. As for the correlation coefficient between IP and ERA for the 2008 season, it was a mere 0.07, which demonstrates a very weak correlation between the two variables. Therefore, just because a reliever pitched more innings did not mean that he would be more effective in terms of ERA for the 2008 season. As for the 2018 season, there were 89 qualifying relievers with 60+IP, but unlike in 2008, there were three relievers that exceeded 90 innings pitched. The ERAs also had a similarly wide range to the 2008 season, going from a low of 0.78 to a high of 5.42, while the median was a pedestrian 3.23. So, the ERAs for 2018 relievers are slightly lower than those for 2008 relievers, but the ranges are very comparable. The ERAs of 2018 relievers varied with a standard deviation of 0.90, which suggests that the variability of performance amongst relievers has somewhat declined since 2008, but one would question whether this is enough of a dip in the standard deviation of ERAs to forecast a further decrease in reliever volatility. With respect to the correlation coefficient between the 2018 ERAs and IP, it was -0.14, which again suggests a fairly weak correlation between the two variables. Clearly, reliever performance has a similar level of variability in the 2018 season when compared to relievers from the 2008 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, through an examination of reliever data from recent MLB seasons, we saw that although there has been an appreciable increase in both reliever pay and usage on the diamond, there was still too much variability among ERAs and not enough correlation between usage and effectiveness to suggest that relievers should be paid any more than they currently are being paid. No doubt, relievers are changing the game by taking the weight off starters and even opening games at times; this theory would have been shot down even a few years ago, and there are still a fair share of critics who ascribe to old-fashioned baseball and an aberration for all things analytics. And even though ERAs and standard deviations of ERAs have technically lowered since 2008, the variability from reliever to reliever is still too noticeable for front offices to be handing out such large sums of money to middle-of-the-road bullpen guys. Personally, I'd like to see how relievers do over the next few years before making any snap decisions about whether or not they are as effective as some MLB executives believe. Only time will tell if these relievers are worth all the hype.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alex Veroulis</name></author><summary type="html">In Major League Baseball (MLB), a reliever is defined as any pitcher who is substituted for a starting pitcher to help finish a game.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell Westbrook has become one of the NBA's top players in the past decade. He has been a marvel to watch, as his thrilling athleticism has allowed him to churn out highlight after highlight. On top of his exhilarating play-style, he has become a fan favorite due to his curt interviews and his redemptive MVP season after Kevin Durant so infamously snaked Russ and the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, his role as a point guard has drawn some ire from basketball fans. Although point guards are generally defined as floor generals who control the offense of the team, Russ has somewhat defied this tradition, as he plays the position with a ball-dominant style that has limited his efficiency. Currently, Russ leads the league in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stats?season=2017&amp;category=SCORING&amp;group=1&amp;sort=7&amp;time=0&amp;pos=0&amp;team=0&amp;qual=1&amp;sortOrder=0&amp;opp=0&amp;page=1&quot;&gt;field goal attempts&lt;/a&gt; at 21.2 per game, and was the second in the league in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=TOUCHES&amp;dir=1&quot;&gt;touches&lt;/a&gt; at 95.3 per game in the 2017-18 season. As a player with such a high usage, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clutchpoints.com/would-russell-westbrook-have-had-a-better-career-if-he-was-a-shooting-guard/&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; comes up somewhat frequently: would Russ be better as a shooting guard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring a unique perspective to this debate, we decided to tackle it with a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a form of regression that predicts a binary dependent variable from an independent variable or a collection of them. We figured that we could consider the classification of a guard as a point guard or shooting guard as a binary regression problem, and create a model around this. Then, we could run Russ's stats through our model and see what it classifies Russ as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We collected advanced and basic statistics of all guards since the 1979-80 season. We chose the 1979-80 season as the starting point because this was the first season where the 3-point line was introduced; thus, all of the advanced statistics for players from that season onwards are complete. To predict the position, we first included all of the 43 predictors in the logistic model. Next, we removed the highly correlated predictors, then conducted a stepwise variable selection process using AIC as our criterion. We ended up with 14 variables that constituted our new model. To check the accuracy of our new model, we split the data into training and testing sets, then calculated the mean squared error of the predictions of testing data. The result showed that our model was 89% accurate in classifying guards as either point guards or shooting guards. After building the classification model, we applied the model onto Westbrook's statistics for each year to classify his position, and the results proved to be very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;cover photo&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our model classified him as a shooting guard only in the 2011-12 season, which is particularly noteworthy, since this is the only season in his career that one of his teams made the NBA Finals. Thus, we decided to focus our deeper analysis on this season and the 2016-17 season, when he won the MVP award. We also chose to mostly examine his offensive traits, since this is the side of the ball where his status as a guard is contentious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental difference between these two seasons is the team that surrounded Russ. Just take a look at how the Thunder's win shares were distributed over these two seasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, he had a lot more talent surrounding him in 2012 than in 2017. With three future MVPs on the squad in Russ himself, Kevin Durant, and James Harden, the 2012 Thunder team was very stacked, and allowed for a more even distribution of contribution throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any given day, any one of Durant, Harden, or Westbrook could go off and give the opposing defense hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCUwuSwmcck&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allowed for some of the most dynamic basketball we have seen in the last few decades. Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/R_Voow0DDmg?t=228&quot;&gt;this incredible play&lt;/a&gt; from the 2012 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. Here, Harden gets the ball on a swing pass and decides to drive into the teeth of the defense. When he sees three Spurs collapse on him, he sneaks an incredibly difficult skip-pass to an open Russ on the wing. Instead of popping the three, Russ blows by the senior citizen Tony Parker, who has no hope in keeping up. Then, he craftily maneuvers around Tim Duncan's attempted charge to finish an insane layup. While Kevin Durant was not directly involved in this play, his gravity plays a massive role in this layup coming to fruition. Note that as Russ goes in for the layup, Kawhi Leonard has two choices: help on the drive and leave Durant wide open from the arc, or stay home on his man. If he helps, he leaves an elite 3-point shooter wide open; if he doesn't help, he gives an elite penetrator a fairly clear lane (which is what happened in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;SLAM Magazine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having these three players on the floor at once opened up so many avenues of attack for Oklahoma City. Either all three could get involved in the play (which often didn't happen because of Scott Brooks's abysmal coaching, but that's material for another article), or two of them could run a nice two-man game with the floor opened up due to the third player. Also, with three marquee players who could bring the ball up and initiate offense, the Thunder did not have to rely solely on Russ to make something happen every possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Harden and Durant left, this changed dramatically. In his MVP season, Russ's best offensive companions were Enes Kanter, Steven Adams and Victor Oladipo. These players, while good in their own rights, were a far cry from the MVP-calibre talents that were Durant and Harden. As a result, the Thunder ran as Russ ran.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic6.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we see here, Westbrook shared a relatively larger piece of the pie for his team in points, assists, and rebounds in 2017 than in 2012. Also, between the two seasons, his assist percentage (the percentage of teammate field goals a player assisted while he was on the floor) nearly doubled, from 29.8% in 2012 to 57.3% in 2017. His usage percentage also increased, but not as dramatically (32.7% to 41.7%). Still, his 41.7% usage good enough to be the highest mark in the league that season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the team to be successful, they had to feed the ball to Russ and let him work his magic. In many ways, this philosophy did work. Watching Russ run the fast-break was (and still is) an absolute delight. Often, Kanter and Adams would either grab rebounds, or box out opponents so that Russ himself could get the ball. Then, Russ would streak down the floor, display some supreme ball-handling talents and either &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Dtb10PeLF2s?t=85&quot;&gt;lay it in with ease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Jmc4KMDs2CA?t=64&quot;&gt;smash in a scintillating dunk&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being a lethal scorer on the fast-break, Russ also had great vision in transition, where he could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rnCCLRMK-8&quot;&gt;weave the ball through nearly impossible passing lanes&lt;/a&gt; when his team got running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the half-court, Russ also utilized some excellent tools. With his big men, Adams and Kanter, Russ often ran the pick-and-roll, where he could either &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/paJ85RCJDh4?t=1431&quot;&gt;find one of them on the roll&lt;/a&gt; or finish himself, either on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/paJ85RCJDh4?t=84&quot;&gt;mid-range pull-up&lt;/a&gt; that he has mastered or on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/paJ85RCJDh4?t=194&quot;&gt;layup/dunk in the paint&lt;/a&gt;. His vision also assisted him in the half-court game, where he could &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3KLWle7B8wo?t=65&quot;&gt;find his teammates cutting backdoor with slick passes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic7.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Steven Adams, Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2016-17 season, Russ famously averaged a triple double, won the MVP award and lead the Thunder to 47 wins, keeping his team in the playoff hunt after Kevin Durant left the team in cowardly fashion the previous offseason. However, while they had relative success with Russ at the helm, the Thunder also suffered at the hands of their star. As anyone who watches Westbrook with any regularity knows, he is not always the best decision maker on the floor, as he often barrels into the rim for &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9TO4yjEfMUg?t=76&quot;&gt;reckless shots&lt;/a&gt;, turns the ball over in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GnJ7xe-2MY&quot;&gt;extraordinary fashion&lt;/a&gt; or generally just does &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jz9M4LIRD0&quot;&gt;things that should not be done on a basketball court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9TO4yjEfMUg?t=47&quot;&gt;This play&lt;/a&gt; encapsulates many of the criticisms of Russell Westbrook. As the play sets up, you can see some nice action off the ball, as Alex Abrines cuts towards the basket at the top of the key off a nice screen. He is clearly looking at Russ, expecting him to slip the ball in for either an easy layup or a kick-out to Jerami Grant if Klay Thompson helped one pass away. Instead, Russ barrels into the basket and takes an ill-advised layup on three Warriors that gets swatted into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russ's boneheaded decisions certainly hurt his stock as a point guard. Even in his incredible MVP season, while had quite a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raDYzXmmQEA&quot;&gt;memorable late-game moments&lt;/a&gt;, he also had an equal amount of not-so-memorable late-game moments, where he would miss deep, off-balance 3s and heavily contested layups when better shots were available. Though he was the reason OKC won the majority of their games, he was also often the reason they lost the games they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5iRmnl4mpU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And as we saw, a team that lived by the Russ and died by the Russ petered out in the first round of the playoffs, losing to James Harden's Rockets in five games. When he was forced to be the ultimate floor general, he stuffed the stat sheet for himself, but his team did not do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic8.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, he did not have two other MVPs by his side. And, a lot of his decision-making woes existed even in the season when he played more of a &quot;shooting guard&quot; role (according to our model). After Game 2 of the 2012 NBA Finals, when Russ chucked up 26 shots in a loss, Magic Johnson famously called Russ &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thebiglead.com/2017/08/10/magic-johnson-on-russell-westbrook-in-2012-finals-worst-point-guard-in-nba-finals-history/&quot;&gt;the worst point guard in a Championship Finals&lt;/a&gt;&quot; he had ever seen. While his teammates Durant and Harden had 32 and 21 on 54.5% and 63.6% shooting (respectively), Russ only shot 38.4% from the field. For obvious reasons, Magic was angry at the fact that the Russ kept on shooting on an off night instead of feeding the hot hands, as a point guard should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps those numbers would be easier to stomach if he weren't playing the role of a floor general. Most volume scorers have nights of inefficiency, but also have more leeway in terms of shooting themselves back into the game, since scoring is their main offensive role. However, elite point guards who are expected to run their offense with gravitas and poise should engage their hot players, especially when they are in shooting slumps. Maybe if Russ stuck to the role closer to a shooting guard after the 2011-12 season, he might have been able to hone his scoring skills and avoid the brunt of learning how to become a better facilitator on offense. With a more off-ball role, he could have risen to even higher highs than he already has in his great career. And possibly, if he had done these things, he could have &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779267-kevin-durant-on-2016-free-agency-meeting-with-warriors-i-needed-that-validation&quot;&gt;convinced Kevin Durant to stay&lt;/a&gt; in Oklahoma City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it might not be too late to fall back on his shooting guard roots. As a point guard, his offense relies heavily on his explosive athleticism. Our classification model shows that as age increases, the proportion of point guards in each age group decreases. After 28 years old, which is around the peak of players' athleticism, guards are more likely to be shooting guards (Russ is 30 years old right now, FYI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic9.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russ passes the peak of his athleticism, his offensive efficiency might decrease if he continues to play the way he does now. Russ possess the qualities to become a good off-ball player, as we saw in his relatively successful 2011-12 &quot;shooting guard&quot; season. Looking more currently, his catch-and-shoot scoring has been improving over the past few years. According to NBA.com, in the 2017-18 season, Russ ranked in the 87.6th percentile in spot-up shooting, with 1.16 points per possession. However, this play-type only made up 4.7% of Westbrook's offensive plays last season. Given his offensive awareness and off-ball scoring ability, if he tries to play more off-ball at the shooting guard position, it might be more efficient for him as a scorer and beneficial for the team.  Even though Kevin Durant and James Harden aren't walking through that door again, OKC has an All-Star in Paul George, a capable point guard in Dennis Schroder, a tank in Steven Adams, a four who is better than Melo in Jerami Grant, and more. The squad has a lot of potential, and Russ can potentially unlock that potential by shifting his play-style a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic10.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Layne Murdoch, Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fellow Bruins, we love Russ and want him to succeed more than anything. It would be so heartwarming if Russ could get over the hump of the first round of the playoffs that he hasn't been able to conquer without Durant at his side. He won the MVP award without Durant; now it's time for him to win in the playoffs without him.&lt;/p&gt;

Each year, the highest ranked teams from all European leagues automatically qualify or enter the preliminary stages of this tournament. In the end, 32 teams participate in a grueling group stage, where every team plays each other twice. The top two teams from all 8 groups make the first knockout stage. Each knockout matchup has two games, other than the final which has one. As a result, the UCL format generally ensures that the team who wins must consistently play well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To win the UCL, a team must have a strategy that is effective enough to overcome the lengthy group stage, three 2-legged knockout ties, and a high-pressure final match against another top team. Over the years, no system has been as romanticized as one that is possession-based. Teams such as the Netherlands national team of the 70s, the World Cup-winning Spanish national team, and Barcelona in the 21st century have been famed for their successful application of this strategy. More recently, Manchester City has dominated the English Premier League with coach Pep Guardiola, renowned for this system, at the helm. In this article, I will attempt to analyze if a play style centered around possession is truly the best method for guaranteeing success in the UCL. Statistics from the 2017-18 edition of the competition will be used for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Real Madrid celebrates their third UCL title in a row - Source: Fox Sports&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measuring Performance of All Teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key for &quot;Stage Reached&quot; Variable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before analysis can be performed, there must be a variable present to measure the level of success of teams in the competition. As a result, a quantitative variable is created to indicate the progression of a club. As indicated by the table above, any value equal to or greater than 3 demonstrates that a team qualified for the knockout stage of the 2017-18 UEFA Champions League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possession percentage is the most basic way of modeling a team's strategy. The histogram shows that the possession splits of sides will generally remain closer to 50/50, especially as teams in the competition are generally of comparable ability. However, being at or above a possession percentage of 50 seems to almost ensure a knockout round place. Every team that made the quarter-finals, other than Juventus, had at least a percentage of 50. On the other hand, a clear outlier is Benfica, who finished last in their group with a 54.7% possession per game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparison between Chelsea and Benfica demonstrates how play style is not the sole deciding factor in team success. Chelsea averaged 47.2% possession per game but scored 2.1 goals per game, whereas Benfica had a measly average of 0.2 goals per game. What this proves is that retaining the ball for the majority of the match means nothing unless a team is able to create and finish opportunities. In theory, greater possession should translate to more chances created, which would lead to more goals being scored. However, the case of Benfica, who finished the group stage with 6 losses in 6 matches, demonstrates that a team's finishing ability also plays a large part in their potential success. Furthermore, the correlation between possession and team success tapers off as the competition progresses. This hints at the notion that teams who can retain the ball well are able to fend off weaker teams, but are not ensured victory against stronger opposition. This is understandable, as top clubs and top players are able to create chances with less opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the relationship between the amount of shots taken and the stage reached shows that there is not a very high correlation between taking shots and winning matches, as many teams are averaging similar numbers of shots while reaching different stages of the competition. Clearly, both the quality of the shots a team takes and the finishing capabilities of the players must impact the level of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, finishing remains a vital part of the game. No team who scored one goal or less made it out of the group stage. Teams who are making the later stages are also scoring more in general. However, as with the analysis of possession percentages, the correlation weakens as the competition progresses towards the knockouts. Performing well in these categories seems to indicate that a team should progress out of the groups, but not necessarily that they will last much longer. The two outliers on the high scoring end of the spectrum are Liverpool, who was a finalist, and PSG, who went out in the first knockout stage. Still, the opposite is not true, as teams who are reaching the latter stages must be performing adequately in terms of these statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyzing the Performance of the Finalists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Gareth Bale of Real Madrid attempts an audacious goal against Liverpool - Source: Le Parisien&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final of the 2017-18 UCL, Real Madrid and Liverpool faced off in what turned out to be the former's third straight title, a truly astonishing feat. Real Madrid came in with a squad teeming with experienced stars. Their preferred midfield trio of Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, and Casemiro continually dominated the opposition with their intelligent movement and creative passing. Liverpool found success due to their high-octane offense, featuring speedy players such as Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic7.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table above displays some interesting points of data. Real Madrid ranks 11th in the number of long balls per game, whereas Liverpool ranks 3rd. This is the one passing statistic in the table that is generally known to have an adverse effect on the overall possession of a team, as long-range passing is riskier and carries a lower rate of success. Furthermore, Liverpool falls out of the top 10 in three of the primary possession statistics. These trends demonstrate that Liverpool ignored the allure of a possession-based style in favor of a fast-paced system. They were clearly effective as well, as the team placed similarly to Real Madrid in the rankings for goals and created shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possession-based play style remains a viable option for a team searching for a fruitful strategy, but there is only a certain stage a concentration on this strategy can take a club. Weaker teams can be defeated through dedication to this style, but stronger sides will be able to counterattack more effectively. As a result, knockout round success is difficult to predict based on the metrics provided in this article alone. There is no consistent &quot;winning formula&quot; for success in the Champions League, which is a testament to the difficulty that comes with winning the competition. For the knockout stages, teams must find a system that works best for the players they have. Possession was the primary focus of this article, but deeper studies of counterattacking and defensive approaches would allow for a better understanding of what is truly the best strategy for succeeding in the UCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ray Lewis Ravens, '85 Bears, and Belichick Giants are some of the greatest defenses the National Football League has ever seen. They were stone walls, high-powered, and champions. Scoring more than ten points against any of these teams was an accomplishment- a win in and of itself. However, scoring less than twenty against any team nowadays is almost always another notch in the loss column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern NFL is chock full of defenses who fail to rise to the occasion, ushering in an era of high powered offense and high scoring games. No matter the reasons for this phenomenon (although we'll get to that later), the transition is apparent and an undeniable fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Rams put this trend on display when the two teams combined for 105 points, 1001 yards, and 56 first downs. This would be absolutely shocking for the football world only a few decades ago. Although that particular scoreline is still the largest of the season, games including Chiefs-Patriots, Saints-Buccaneers, and Browns-Raiders all had score totals of 83, 88, and 87 respectively. As of week 12, games are averaging a record 48.4 total points per game. Even more impressively, four of the seventeen highest scoring games in NFL history have come this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total offensive points have increased dramatically over the last 60 years as indicated by the graph below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;*The 2018 season is ongoing, thus showing a smaller overall value than previous years.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what is causing this apparent lapse in defensive ability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One argument centers around NFL rules and officiating. A sudden emphasis on the roughing the passer rule this year has resulted in defensive players displaying caution around the quarterback, allowing offenses to take advantage of the hesitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prominent example was displayed in primetime when Chiefs linebacker Breeland Speaks let go of Tom Brady after having two arms around him because he &quot;*thought the ball was gone&quot; and did not want to risk getting a penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYVVmrdv54o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Various NFL defensive players have expressed frustration with this type of officiating. Star Saints Defensive End Cameron Jordan stated that in order to sack a quarterback without receiving a penalty, you must &quot;**put a pillow underneath his head [and] read him a bedtime story.&quot; Hyperbole aside, the numbers seem to back up his sentiment. Even though the &quot;roughing the passer&quot; part of the rule book was completely left alone this offseason, the frequency of the penalty has increased 65% in the first six weeks of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, a series of rule adjustments that favor receivers in the open field, including the protections of defenseless players and an increased emphasis on defensive pass interference, have also most likely resulted in an increased ability for offenses to earn yards and score. If we take a look at the table below, the ratio of Defensive Pass Interference calls to total pass attempts has narrowed every single year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defensive Pass Interference in the NFL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, defenses around the league might just be really bad. There are plenty examples already this season of defensive players making low effort tackles on runners in the open field, resulting in tremendously long plays and touchdowns. For example, in the Dolphins' game against the Bears in Week 6, quarterback Brock Osweiler threw 380 yards and three touchdowns. This is interesting, considering that all but one of his completions came within 15 yards of the line of scrimmage. This means that most of his total passing yards came from yards after the catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;*source: nfl.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visualization above is a representation of Brock Osweiler's game against the Bears. It displays how far away from the line of scrimmage the receiver catches the ball, disregarding yards after the catch. According to the key, all three of his touchdown passes came from completions within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage. One of these touchdowns was a 43 yard completion over the middle with three missed tackles by Bears defenders in the open field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_lzD_jr1HE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Kansas City Chiefs' record-setting 10-game streak of scoring a touchdown of 50 yards or longer has exposed just how bad defenses are this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and most potentially potent theory revolves around the gradual transition from run-heavy games to passing gameplans. The switch from majority running to majority passing teams came over 30 years ago when elite quarterbacks rose up to produce far more yards than were previously possible. However, the uptick has not yet stopped, and offenses are still moving more and more away from the run. The graph below displays the number of first downs achieved by each team per game. The trendlines shown have r-values of 0.89 and 0.84 for passing and running respectively, strong linear correlations dictating associations between the years that have passed and the rates of first downs according to these different methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;*source: nfl.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing in the NFL, in conjunction with the aforementioned rule changes that favor passing, are creating high-scoring and high-yardage games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, defenses are struggling constantly now, and it has become rarer and rarer for them to be successful against modern, high-powered offenses. All important offensive metrics, total yards, total points, and first downs all point towards offenses reaching all-time highs in these categories this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The causes of this phenomenon are three-fold: nfl officiating, limited ability, and a transition from run to pass. The league is changing in what aspects of the game it values, and offense is at the top. It is no surprise as well that NFL ratings are up 5% this year for the first time in over six years. These high-scoring games, while mostly a spectacle of fast playmakers running up and down the field, are very entertaining to the general public. While football purists might be barking on Sportscenter about a return to &quot;real&quot; football, this new game will be the NFL for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

They were stone walls, high-powered, and champions. Scoring more than ten points against any of these teams was an accomplishment- a win in and of itself. However, scoring less than twenty against any team nowadays is almost always another notch in the loss column.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Can Summer Ball Indicate Professional Success?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/summerBall" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Can Summer Ball Indicate Professional Success?" /><published>2018-12-03T23:04:46-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-03T23:04:46-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/summerBall</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/summerBall">&lt;p&gt;Every summer, hundreds of college baseball players participate in summer leagues around the country. One of the most acclaimed of these leagues is the Cape Cod Baseball League, which consists of 10 teams across the Cape Cod peninsula. Collegiate summer leagues have support from both Major League Baseball and the NCAA, and are intended to help advance players from the collegiate to professional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of October 2015, 1155 past players from the Cape Cod Baseball League had made an appearance in at least one MLB game. Some veterans in this group include household names like Rich Hill, Chase Utley, and George Springer. Looking at the Boston Red Sox 2018 World Series Roster, 8 out of 25 players, including World Series MVP Steve Pearce, participated in the Cape Cod Baseball League. There are more veterans of this summer league on the Boston Red Sox than any other major league team. When Chris Sale played for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox in 2009, he was third in ERA and recorded the most strikeouts throughout the season. Could there be a correlation between performance in summer leagues like the CCBL and professional success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep it simple, we'll focus on batting performance as an indicator of potential in the MLB. With the wide acceptance of advanced analytics in baseball, more attention has been placed on batting statistics like slugging and on-base percentage, as opposed to the unreliable statistic of batting average. Slugging and on-base percentage are more precise and accurate measurements for offensive production; they reward batters who make it on base and thus those who create more scoring opportunities. OPS combines these two statistics into one. Although this stat unfairly weighs OBP and SLG as equal (and according to Fangraphs, OBP is about 1.8 times more important than SLG), OPS still paints an accurate picture of a player's offensive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the collegiate and professional levels, a high mark in this category indicates tremendous offensive power. Accordingly, players in the Cape Cod Baseball League who eclipse their teammates and opponents in offensive categories have a promising future. Let's look at the top batting performers in the CCBL from 2004-2013 and analyze how the performance of eventual professional players compares to the top performers in the years they played on the Cape.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/sumBall/pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the graph above, OPS is plotted against the number of RBIs for the top 10 batters of each season of the CCBL from 2004 to 2013. The blue dots represent the players who achieved tremendous success in the MLB; these players include Jason Kipnis, Buster Posey, and Jackie Bradley Jr. A trend line for the professional players models the positive relationship between the number of RBIs and OPS. For every increase in OPS by .041, players are predicted to get an RBI. The blue dots tend to be clustered close to the regression line and the eventual MLBers who did well in the CCBL had more than 20 RBIs and an OPS higher than 0.900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's obvious that the eventual pros did not blow away their competitors in offensive production. However, there does seem to be a balance between OPS and RBIs that makes a player excel beyond the collegiate level. Let's use the regression line for the eventual MLB players to see how players from the 2018 season of the CCBL compare.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/sumBall/pic2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive relationship between OPS and RBI remains, but there are only a handful of players with more than 20 RBIs and an OPS over .900. Let's look at some of the players from last year's CCBL that meet these criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2018 season of the Cape Cod League, Austin Shenton of the Wareham Gatemen was third in batting with an average of .349 and an OPS of .940. Last year at Florida International University, he batted an astounding .344 with OPS of .941. Shenton was named the Postseason MVP for the CCBL 2018 playoffs as he lead the Wareham Gatemen to the championship. D1Baseball predicted he would be a breakout player this summer. They also detailed Shenton's incredibly mental approach to the game which no doubt had an impact on his performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranked above Shenton in CCBL batting average was Matthew Barefoot of the Hyannis Harbor Hawks who lead the league with a whopping .379.He also led the league with a .474 OBP, reaching base on almost half of his plate appearances. In 2017, Barefoot batted .335 with OPS of .937 for Campbell University and he helped propel the team into the spring NCAA tournament. With little expertise on defense, Barefoot may struggle to get to the majors. However, his batting performance was sure to get the scouts' attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we'll look at Noah Campbell from the University of South Carolina. He crushed the Cape Cod Baseball League with a .636 slugging percentage, that's .063 more than the next closest player. He was also third in the league with an on-base percentage of of .456. At South Carolina last year, Campbell batted .286 with OPS of .752. He doesn't boast the highest batting average, but his immense power hitting ability blows everyone else away. Aside from a finger injury last March, there is little doubt surrounding Campbell. He is a force both offensively and defensively and has unquestionable potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in his season in the Cape Cod Baseball League, World Series Champion Jackie Bradley Jr. was impressive with 14 RBIs and a .717 OPS, yet he didn't outshine his competitors offensively. He didn't outperform our highlighted 2018 CCBL players either. However, with his relentless work ethic, Bradley made it to the major leagues and was the definition of clutch in this past world Series. He possessed that x-factor needed to excel in professional baseball. Shenton, Barefoot, and Campbell undoubtedly have the offensive power to do damage in the MLB, and their work ethics show promise for professional success.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Haley Rao</name></author><summary type="html">Every summer, hundreds of college baseball players participate in summer leagues around the country.

After missing the playoffs for blank consecutive years, the Lakers look to make a playoff run and possibly contend for a championship title with the addition of the NBA's most prominent star. In addition to Lebron James, the Lakers added notable veterans such as Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Lance Stephenson. However, the Lakers remain at their core a very young team, with blossoming players with high potentials. These young players who look to be the future of the franchise are Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball. In this article, I will focus on these young players, analyzing their individual game log data I retrieved from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.basketball-reference.com/&quot;&gt;Basketball-Reference.com&lt;/a&gt; and using John Hollinger's Game Score statistic as a metric in determining the success each player had the last 2017-18 season in each game they played in. Game Score is a more complex metric that was designed to roughly estimate the success of a player's single game. If you are interested in knowing how Game Score is exactly calculated, you can find the informaion in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/game-score/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. My goal in analyzing this data is to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each player from the perspective of exactly how each succeeded relative to their average performances of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why GameScore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the choice of analyzing the young core's strengths and weaknesses through the lens of GameScore based upon GameScore's reptuable history and also based upon a convenience standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Hollinger, the man who devised the formula for GameScore, is known as an early leader of basketball analytics, and is currently the Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Memphis Grizzlies. To verify the accuracy of Gamescore as a metric for individual success, I found that two of the most iconic individual performances, Michael Jordan's 69 point, 18 rebound game against Cleveland in 1990 and Kobe Bryant's 81 point game against Toronto in 2006, were the highest GameScores since 1983.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, Basketball-Reference.com provides individual player boxscore data with GameScore included. Thus, GameScore became both a logical and convenient choice to use as a measurement of individual success for the young Lakers core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploring the Data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start my stastical analyisis, I began by exploring the data. First, we can take a quick look at the distributions of Game Score for each player, as well as comparing the mean Game Score for each player in the following charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;lonzowire.usatoday.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these histograms, we can notice that the distribution of the Game Score's were roughly similiar to normal distributions with the exception of outliers. We want to capture what the greatest predictors are of each individual's Game Score relative to their own average performance on the year. In other words, we want to find out exactly what that player did exceptionally well or exceptionally poorly to merit a good or bad game score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above chart we can see the average Game Scores for each player for the 2017-2018 season. Visually, we can see that the young core all have about the same average Game Scores, with the exception of Hart, who played the least amount of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methodology and Rationale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a statistical standpoint, my primary methodology predicting the Game Score statstic using variables from the game logs as my predictive variables through a multiple linear regression model. The rationale behind choosing such a model is for interperatable purposes, as it is clear from the output of this model the effects of each variable in predicting the statistic Game Score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An essential part of building these models is the question of normalizing the data. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to normalize by individual since this will tell us what the individual should work on more for their own personal game, not compared to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the models, I tested the subsets up to a total of five predictors through an exhaustive search, choosing the model with the highest adjusted R2. If you are interested in learning more about the models built or datasets you can visit the datasets and code on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jgyee/BSA-Young-Lakers-Data-Game-Score-Analysis&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. The following charts below summarize my results for these models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;lonzowire.usatoday.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding the Keys to Success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us now break up the models and analyze each separately, giving recommendations to each player their &quot;keys to success&quot;, and what parts of their game they should work on more, basing our suggestions on the coefficients of the models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Hart, his field goal atempts most drastically affects his Gamescore negatively relative to his fellow teammates, meaning he should &lt;b&gt;focus on better shot attempts&lt;/b&gt;. The other coefficients of Hart's model rank all fairly high compared to the rest of the young core, alluding to Hart's strong overall game and lack of offensive deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Kuzma, his turnovers most adversely affect his Gamescore negatively in comparison to the other players, meaning he should focus on being more careful with the ball. In addition, his field goal attempts do not dramatically decrease his Gamescore compared to his fellow teammates. These two factors may be indicative of Kuzma &lt;b&gt;continuing to be aggressive shooting the ball&lt;/b&gt;, but to temper that aggression with more patience when driving or passing, which can lead to costly turnovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ingram, his field goals most positively improve his performance, so he should focus on staying aggressive and &lt;b&gt;being a primary scoring option&lt;/b&gt;. His free throw coefficient is lagging behind that of Kuzma and Hart. To improve, he can focus on drawing more fouls and get to the line more. Additionally, he can &lt;b&gt;improve his free throw percentage&lt;/b&gt;, so that when he does get to the line, he converts those attempts into points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ball, his assists and steals most positively affect his Gamescore relative to the other three players. Unsurprisingly, Lonzo's passing is the strongest part of his game and contributes to the majority of his success in his best games. For him to succeed, he must &lt;b&gt;keep his assists up&lt;/b&gt;, maintain aggressive on defensive possessions, as well as &lt;b&gt;improve on his scoring ability.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking across the various models, we have noticed some differences between the players. These results are somewhat suprising, as they give us a different perspective than looking at a player's overall season statistics, such as Josh Hart's 47% FG% on the season telling us that he is an efficient scorer. This compared to Lonzo Ball's shockingly-low 36% FG% from last season. However, we must keep in mind that these statistics are normalized, so they are adjusted for in respect to that player's average performance. This is the key lens of our models we must look through in order to interpret and know why the results are the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion and Further Remarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key aspects of our analysis that differentiate it from the typical, more basic analysis of a player's performance. From the perspective of looking at singular games rather than a whole season, we can find different results that may give us deeper insight into the success of these players solely on a game-to-game basis. Addtionally, choosing to normalize based on that player's own performances, we can see statistical differences in their own games rather than comparing it to a metric of other players, such as league averages for box-score statistics. I hope by reaading this article, you have gained some extra insight into the games of the Young Lakers Core.

Fans young and old crowd around laptops and televisions, host watch parties with friends, and some even witness the magic in person if lucky enough. From watching new upcomers like Denis Shapovalov and Borna Coric, to legends such as Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, each match is always fun to watch. Of course, just like with every other sport, debating and betting about who will win each match in casual settings as well as in fantasy draws is a crucial part of the entire experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in determining these winners, many people use blind intuition, flip a coin or pick the players they know. We all have that one friend who sees the 26th seed with a record for the most double faults and puts them in the finals of their fantasy draw. But for every ten people using this technique, there is one savvy person looking for data metrics and statistics to help them pick a winner. Tennis data can be obtained from various places, with little to no information of the accuracy of the data. Still, there are clearly reliable, verified sites such at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/ stats/1701.html?promo=matchchanger&quot;&gt;IBM SlamTracker data&lt;/a&gt;, which is the site from which this data was obtained. However, there is no real indication for the person trying to predict the winner of a match whether these statistics actually matter, or which statistics matter more than others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/summTennis/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The 2018 Men's Tennis U.S. Open Trophy (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/376965431287972606/&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this article, we look at match data for every single match in U.S. Open 2018 and analyze the summary statistics of the winner of every match to see if they are good predictors of winning matches. If they are, we can further analyze these summary statistics to see if we can find the most accurate predictor of winning matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/summTennis/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first graph is a bar graph of the % occurrence of each summary statistic in a winning match. The first important thing to take note of is the y-axis, where the percentages are displayed. What is very important to note is that it starts at 50%, meaning that there is always a greater percentage of matches where the winner is leading in every single summary statistic. This is very important, as it tells us that all of these summary stats are relevant and do actually factor in predicting a winner. Beyond that, we can take a look at each of the summary statistics, and see which one is the most accurate predictor in determining the winner of a match. Looking at the bar graph, it is clear that &quot;more receiving points won&quot; is the most important category (91.34%). Obviously this makes sense; most professional tennis players hold serve with relative ease, whereas &quot;breaking serve&quot;, or winning the serve games of opponents, is what changes the actual outcome of the match. Another important measurement to note is the percent occurrence of the aggressive versus the defensive measurements, and what that says about the data. For example, when comparing the aggressive measurements such as the &quot;more aces&quot; and &quot;more winners&quot; categories and the defensive measurements such as &quot;less double faults&quot; and &quot;less unforced errors&quot;, it is clear that a greater percentage of the winning matches contain aggressive statistics than defensive statistics. This is very important, because it contradicts the &quot;defense is the best Offense&quot; theory. It suggests the importance of being a more aggressive player, and gives way to a range of possible topics to explore, in the context of the benefits of an offensive or a defensive playing style. We can analyze these summary statistics further, as we take a look at the filtered version showing results for only Novak Djokovic, the winner of the 2018 U.S. Open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/summTennis/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Novak Djokovic, as the winner of the tournament, would have won all of his matches: because of this, his data would follow the data for the summary statistics (which we have determined as a good predictors to some extent). Djokovic's data presents an interesting contrast to the previous observations: his defensive qualities show up more. The 3 most offensive statistics (more aces, higher 1st serve % in, and more winners) show up the least in all the metrics, which confounds with the data accumulated from the winner of every single match. We can take the future research options we were looking into before (the usefulness of offense vs. defense) and narrow our focus, seeing if there is a difference between general victors and the champions of each tournament in terms of playing style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is clear that the data being collected for the matches, rather than just a measure of a given player in a given match, allows us to make some sort of an insightful decision on the winner of a match. Using the sample size of one tournament, of course, is too small to see how accurate of a predictor the summary statistics are, but it does provide an indication that these summary statistics can be useful when drawing inferences. In the future, we have many new avenues of research that open up to us. We could expand the observations to include every single tournament of 2017, and see if those summary statistics played a factor in shaping the results of 2018. We could also compare general winners to the tournament champion, and see if winning the tournaments comes from a different playing style or outperforming the other players in the same playing style. At least we know there is one thing to take note of: listening to that one friend who has a gut feeling that the player who has the most double faults will win the tournament isn't such a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gautham Pasupathy</name></author><summary type="html">Four times a year, the entire tennis community gathers to witness one of the most spectacular events&amp;#58; The Grand Slams.
