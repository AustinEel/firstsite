&lt;p&gt;
    Women’s collegiate soccer is thriving on the west coast. Less than two months ago, the championship game of the College Cup saw two Pac-12 powerhouses go head-to-head in Orlando, Florida. Stanford emerged with a 3-2 victory over UCLA to secure their second title since 2011 and the conference’s fourth in that seven-year span. Both teams are set up extremely well heading into next season, and the road to a national championship appears to run through California.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    The following is a comprehensive introduction to the statistics of NCAA women’s soccer, focusing specifically on Pac-12 teams during conference play. I scraped and organized the data using Python and did the analysis/visuals in R. A couple issues in the data: Stanford’s website does not list minutes played, so all analysis using the minutes variables excludes Stanford players. Also, Oregon State changed the format of their website before the last conference game, so I was unable to get data from their 1-0 win over Oregon. All warnings aside, let’s jump into it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Soccer is a particularly hard sport to quantify; there are very few goals per game and very few games in a season. Without passing data or advanced player tracking technology, we do not have much to work with aside from basic counting statistics. Games played, games started, and minutes played can tell us about the usage of a player, while goals, assists, points (goals*2 + assists), shots, and shots on goal represent offensive production. But there are no specific measurements for defense. Using minutes played per game and percentage of games started (GS/GP) as a proxy can tell us how much a coach trusts a player, but it does not directly measure performance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    In short, counting stats cannot be solely relied upon to judge a player’s value. The eye test is more applicable in soccer compared to most other major sports. However, numbers can still be applied in many situations, a few outlined below. Let’s overview the dynamics of the Pac-12 conference teams during the 2017 season.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Parity in college soccer is relatively low. Stanford was the top team in the country and on a tier of its own in the Pac-12, going a perfect 11-0-0. UCLA and USC followed closely behind, and were legitimate contenders for a national championship. The middle ground of the conference made up schools that at least made the tournament: Arizona, Cal, Colorado, and Washington State. The rest fill out the bottom. A large disparity exists in the talent level between the best and the worst, resulting in few upsets and relatively predictable games. One must be very careful when making comparisons across teams. Here is why:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets//wsoccer18/goalscored.png&quot; alt=&quot;Goals Scored By School&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Notice the large discrepancies. If you’re on a good team, you’re going to have the ball a lot. Teams like Stanford and UCLA dominate possession and get a lot of high quality opportunities (that lead to goals) while limiting their opponent’s. Good players on bad teams simply do not have the quality of teammates around them to facilitate the same volume of scoring chances. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Additionally, positions must be taken into account when comparing players. Forwards and midfielders, for example, often have different roles. Jessie Fleming, a member of Canada’s national team and 2016 Olympian, is often described as the &quot;straw that stirs the drink&quot; for UCLA. She finished fourth on the team with 5 points in 10 conference games (for context, UCLA’s top scorer was Hailie Mace with 15 points in 11 games). Point is that Fleming was not relied upon for offense. She played as a holding midfielder who would control possession and set up the attack from deep. Stanford’s Andi Sullivan holds a similar pedigree as one of the best players in the country, and she did not score at all in conference play. This is why we will not focus too much on offensive numbers, but rather explore other variables that can give more insight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Enter the usage statistics mentioned above; games played, games started, and minutes played. Generally, good players will start most or all of their games played, and will play a lot of minutes. Of course, there will still be variability between teams and some schools may use players in situations where they otherwise wouldn’t if they had a better option. Still, usage statistics are less volatile and more encompassing than pure offensive numbers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Usage by Class&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    How does the distribution among freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors look? Pretty much how you would expect. The more experienced seniors play the most minutes on average. There are some superstar freshmen and some substitute-level seniors, which is why they all have similar ranges. But the overall trend is the further along in college a player is, the more minutes they are likely to play.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets//wsoccer18/usage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Usage by Class&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Three quarters of freshmen come in as substitutes or only play about half of the game. Also note that freshmen average the least GP per player out of the four classes, meaning they are most likely to serve as ‘healthy scratches’ and not play at all. There is typically an adjustment period between club soccer and college, and it’s hard to displace upperclassmen that know the system and have the experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    However, top recruits may be expected to step into a starting role immediately. 10 freshmen started at least 10 games last season. 6 of them were from Stanford, UCLA, or USC. It’s no secret that the top schools usually get the top incoming players. Recruiting is one of the major responsibilities of a coach and is crucial for sustained success. Stanford is a prime example of this. Freshman Catarina Macario was named the ESPNW Player of the Year and took home a myriad of other honors and awards after a historic first season. By sophomore year, many of the top talents have established themselves as starters and the interquartile range condenses leading up to seniors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Games started divided by games played as another useful usage tool as it correlates extremely well with minutes per game played:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets//wsoccer18/gamesplayed.png&quot; alt=&quot;Minutes, Games Played&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Perhaps a model can be made in the future to ‘fill in’ the missing values of Stanford players’ minutes. Just by knowing games played and games started, you can make a pretty accurate guess of minutes per game. Taking into account position and year can paint a clear picture about the usage of a player. An example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Player X (UCLA): 10/11 GS/GP, senior, defense&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Her GS/GP ratio is ~90%. Looking at the graph, we can guess she probably plays between 60-80 minutes per game. This implies that she is a regular starter and as she plays defense for UCLA, she occupies a pretty big role on a top team in the conference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Player X is Mackenzie Cerda. Sure enough, she plays 71 minutes per game and is an experienced starter on the back line for UCLA. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;All-Conference Teams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A useful set of information is released at the end of conference play, the All-Pac-12 Conference Teams. Officials for the conference who watch a lot of soccer come together to compile a first team, second team, and third team consisting of 36 players as well as an All-Freshman team of 12. First years are eligible for the All-Conference teams. While this is a subjective ranking, it provides a solid baseline for cohort analysis. Here is a scatter plot distinguishing All-Conference players based on usage and production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets//wsoccer18/allconf.png&quot; alt=&quot;All-Conference vs. Not&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It's not the prettiest graph because I had to use the discrete variable of GS/GP to include Stanford, but the takeaway is clear. A crucial requisite for being included in one of the All-Conference teams is that a player must be a regular starter for their school. All of the red stars are to the right of that 80% GS/GP threshold. Being a starter appears to take precedence over points scored, which brings us to the case of Anika Rodriguez.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Rodriguez is a forward for UCLA who was tied for third in the Pac-12 with 14 points during conference play. Surely this warrants an inclusion into one of those 36 spots? Apparently not. Rodriguez started 6 of 10 conference games and played less than 50 minutes five times in that span. Perhaps the committee interpreted this as insufficient importance to her team. Rodriguez was an absolute force during the NCAA tournament and an integral part of UCLA's run to the championship game, but her inconsistent usage during conference play was probably why she did not make any of the teams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Which begs the question, had she played for a lesser team and still put up good numbers, would she have been included in one of the three teams? I'd lean towards 'yes'. She would clearly be the main offensive threat on a team like Oregon State or Washington and her minutes and GS/GP would shoot up. That is the issue with using a subjective ranking system like this. If you were going by simply 'who are the best 36 soccer players in the conference', the majority would be from Stanford, UCLA, and USC. But usage and playing opportunity clearly hold weight in these All-Conference teams, which can hinder the perceived value of some of the more talented players buried behind superstars on top schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There is a lot more to explore that I will perhaps look at in future projects, such as a deeper analysis into the makeup of teams and how that translates to success over the course of a season. Or the turnover rate (quality of seniors lost/freshmen gained/transfers) and how that relates to placement the following year. And of course, there is always more data to be acquired. And perhaps scraping box scores to examine events in individual games on a per-minute basis, or expanding to other major conferences to get a sense of college soccer as a whole. Suffice to say, this was just scratching the surface of data analysis that can be applied to NCAA women's soccer.

    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width: 95%&quot;; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pro Bowl Prospects&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Pro prospects nationwide.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    One hot topic for debate among coaches, fans, and analysts who follow college football centers around the role of pro prospects in postseason play (bowl games) and whether or not they should play. This is because several highly-touted players have opted to skip their bowl games to protect their health for their future in the NFL. This trend captures a very small portion of players who de-clare for the NFL Draft, but notable players such as Josh Rosen and Derwin James have skipped their games this year to prevent injuries. While it is unfortunate to see such great talent not on the field one last time, many pro prospects still suit up to play for their school in bowl games. In fact, I am interested to see whether the prospects who did play had a positive or negative impact on their team’s performances during bowl season. After all, even though these players are supremely tal-ented, they might have played cautiously to avoid injury, or they could have been distracted by the possibility of going to the NFL. Whatever the case may be, I plan to look at the performances of the top ten quarterback prospects who played in the postseason (according to WalterFootball.com), as this position arguably has the most impact on the outcome of a game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/darnold.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sam Darnold&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    To begin, the top quarterback prospect to have played in a bowl game was Sam Darnold of USC. Darnold was unable to perform at the level that he has displayed in the past, as his team was de-molished by a ferocious Ohio State defense. The USC offense was only able to muster a measly 7 points in the game, and the touchdown the Trojans did get wasn’t even accounted for by Darnold. The USC star threw for 356 yards with no touchdowns and an interception, which gave him an abysmal 35.0 QBR (quarterback rating), a little more than half of the 68.9 QBR he averaged during the season. Plus, he struggled with being comfortable in the pocket, as he was sacked for a season-high 8 times by the Ohio State defense. This performance was exactly the opposite of what he did in the Rose Bowl last year, where he directed a masterful comeback against Penn State. Perhaps this year Darnold was rattled by distractions from scouts and NFL teams, as he declared for the draft shortly after the loss to Ohio State. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/allen.png&quot; alt=&quot;Josh Allen&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    The next prospect to have played in a bowl was Josh Allen of Wyoming, who shined in his post-season action against Central Michigan. Allen led an explosive Cowboys offense to a 37-14 win, as the quarterback threw for an amazing 3 touchdowns on only 11 completions and 19 total attempts passing for a QBR of 79.2. In addition, Allen had a nice 7-yard run that showed off his improvisational skills. His ability to create plays, arm strength, and impeccable size have im-pressed scouts, who think he is similar to another small-school quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger. His play in this bowl game should improve his draft stock, as it should make up for his struggles in the regular season, where he had a pedestrian 56.2 QBR and had to adjust to a depleted Wyo-ming roster. Five players, including star running back Brian Hill, were lost to the NFL, so Allen had less weapons on offense than last year. This explains why he threw for 12 fewer touchdowns and over 1,000 fewer yards than last season. However, his most recent performance should make him a top-10 draft pick. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/jackson.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lamar Jackson&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Perhaps one of the most electrifying players in all of college football is Lamar Jackson of Louis-ville, last year’s Heisman Trophy winner. The dual-threat quarterback put up similar numbers of-fensively in comparison to last year, as he had 28 passing touchdowns and 18 rushing touchdowns in 2017, while he had 30 passing touchdowns and 21 rushing touchdowns in 2016. However, Jackson’s play dropped off in the bowl game against Mississippi State. In a losing effort, Jackson only led his offense to 6 second-half points, which contributed to their losing effort. Although Jackson thrived on the ground with 158 rushing yards for one touchdown, it was through the air where he struggled mightily. After all, he threw for a mere 171 yards with only 13 completions and a 41.9% completion percentage, which yielded a 47.4 QBR. Even worse, he threw 4 interceptions, and one was when Louisville was driving to take the lead late in the fourth quarter. This perfor-mance should bring up questions about Jackson’s decision-making skills when throwing the ball, which could hurt his draft stock and make him a mid-round pick. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/mayfield.png&quot; alt=&quot;Baker Mayfield&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Next up is this year’s Heisman winner, Baker Mayfield of Oklahoma. A former walk-on, Mayfield has elevated his level of play dramatically over the past three years, as he has led Oklahoma’s pro-lific offense in the pass-happy Big 12 Conference. This year, Mayfield’s numbers were insane, as he threw for 43 total touchdowns against just 6 interceptions, which gave him a stellar 89.7 QBR on the season. Unfortunately, this level of play did not translate to the national semifinal game against Georgia, where his team lost in double overtime 54-48. Mayfield’s offense started out strong, as the team scored on its first four possessions against the talented Georgia defense. But Mayfield could only orchestrate one touchdown drive throughout the second half and both over-times, which allowed Georgia to climb out of a 17-point first-half deficit. Georgia’s halftime ad-justments on defense seemed to stymie Mayfield and the Sooners, which isn’t a good sign for Mayfield since he will be facing much tougher defenses at the next level. Mayfield ended the game with a 64.0 QBR, his worst rating in a game all season. Nevertheless, looking at his whole body of work this season, he deserves to be a first-round pick. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/lock.png&quot; alt=&quot;Drew Lock&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Moving on, there is Drew Lock of Missouri, who struggled for the most part against a mediocre Texas defense that ranked 108th out of 129 FBS teams with 257.9 passing yards allowed per game. Not to mention, but Texas’s top safety DeShon Elliott sat out the game to prepare for the NFL Draft. So, coming into the game, the Missouri offense clearly had a mismatch with a medio-cre Texas team. Lock was largely responsible for Missouri’s 15th best offense in the nation with 37.5 points scored per game. After all, he had a magnificent season with 44 passing touchdowns and 3964 yards through the air. Therefore, it was a surprise to see the explosive Missouri squad only muster 16 points and 269 yards passing, especially when they had just won six games straight with 45+ points scored in each of those contests. Lock didn’t have the inspired performance many scouts expected, as he threw just 18 completions on 34 attempts with one touchdown and one in-terception, which gave him a disappointing 48.0 QBR for the game. The only thing that can explain this result is the change in offensive coordinator for Missouri, but even this is a poor excuse for what should have been an easy win for Lock and the Tigers. Looking at the big picture, this effort should downgrade his draft stock and make him a mid-round pick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/rudolph.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mason Rudolph&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Furthermore, Mason Rudolph of Oklahoma State was one of the few quarterback prospects who met expectations in the postseason. A consistent performer throughout the regular season, Rudolph threw for an impeccable 4904 yards with 37 passing touchdowns to 9 interceptions to give him a respectable 83.8 QBR for the season. His main connection was with star receiver James Washing-ton, who had over 1000 receiving yards this year. Rudolph has impressive size at 6 foot 5 and 230 pounds, and his leadership skills have been highly touted by scouts. This is probably why he was motivated to get his school and teammates a win in the bowl game against Virginia Tech. Rudolph impressed with 351 passing yards, 2 touchdowns, and no interceptions against a stingy Virginia Tech defense that ranked 5th in the nation with 13.5 points allowed per game. This kind of play could translate well to the NFL, where Rudolph will have to face even tougher defenses while con-tinuing to make good decisions. In addition to his skills on the field, his intangibles could earn him a spot in the first few rounds of the draft. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/stidham.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jarrett Stidham&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    The next highest quarterback prospect is Jarrett Stidham, an Auburn standout who transferred from Baylor. Stidham had a decent season on a strong Auburn team, as he led his team to a 10-win sea-son with 3158 passing yards and 18 touchdowns thrown. His 61.0 QBR during the season was good enough to get wins for most of the season, as the Auburn defense carried the team at times, but when better teams like LSU came along, the quarterback’s efforts were not good enough. This was especially evident in their bowl game to UCF, a small-conference opponent who many consid-ered inferior to Auburn before their matchup. Auburn ultimately lost 34-27 to UCF, who complet-ed the nation’s only perfect season this year. Stidham’s play in this game definitely didn’t help Au-burn’s cause, as he threw two interceptions and rushed for negative 25 yards due to the 6 sacks he endured. The 32.0 QBR he earned in this bowl game was miserable, and Auburn’s loss to a small school like UCF could be chalked up to their quarterback play. Stidham didn’t do any favors for himself in terms of his NFL draft standing, as scouts are probably questioning his poise and deci-sion-making skills; he should be a late-round pick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/ferguson.png&quot; alt=&quot;Riley Ferguson&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Another quarterback standout is Riley Ferguson from Memphis, who led his team with prolific offensive numbers that rivaled those of predecessor Paxton Lynch. Ferguson completed 63.1% of his passes, threw for 4257 yards, had 38 passing touchdowns, and possessed a 76.8 QBR on the season. Games versus UCLA and Connecticut made him stand out early in the season and put him on the map for many scouts. Against UCLA, he threw 6 passing touchdowns and torched the UCLA defense with 41 offensive points. In an even better performance versus Connecticut, Fergu-son erupted for 7 passing touchdowns, 431 yards in the air, and had an unbelievable 91.7 QBR for that game. The sustained success that Memphis had under Ferguson’s leadership led the team to the #20 spot in the College Football Playoff Rankings before their bowl matchup against Iowa State. Many believed Memphis would crush Iowa State with a powerful offense, but Ferguson and the Tigers did not show up like they had during the regular season. The star quarterback threw for a modest 286 yards, was sacked 6 times, and had a QBR of 50.1. As a result of this meager quar-terback play, the Tigers only put up 20 points in a 1-point loss, their second fewest points scored by the team all season. Ferguson’s ability to read defenses before the snap could be a weakness that scouts note due to the amount of sacks he took. Due to this poor postseason showing, Fergu-son could be slotted as a late-round pick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/benkert.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kurt Benkert&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    To continue, Kurt Benkert was a bright spot on a Virginia team that ended the season with a losing record. The quarterback threw for 3207 yards passing and 25 touchdowns against just 9 intercep-tions, and he has shown flashes of greatness against Boise State and Miami. In the Boise State game, Benkert led Virginia to victory with 3 passing touchdowns in a 42-23 win. Against Miami, he had a gutsy performance with 4 passing touchdowns and an insane 384 passing yards that put him on the radar. Unfortunately, these efforts did not translate to the all-important bowl game against Navy, where Benkert had arguably his worst game of the season. He threw for only 145 yards, did not account for a touchdown, threw an interception, and had an awful 10.7 QBR for the game. As a result, Virginia was pounded by Navy 49-7, and there were no positive takeaways from this game for Benkert. Navy’s defense wasn’t even that great this season, as they allowed just under 28 points per game coming into this matchup. So, scouts must be concerned about Benkert’s potential performances against NFL defenses that feast on mistakes from quarterbacks. Due to his recent efforts, Benkert is poised to be a late-round pick.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/proprospects2018/white.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mike White&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The last quarterback prospect to be analyzed is Mike White of Western Kentucky, who thrived dur-ing the regular season under a pass-happy offense. Specifically, White has thrown for 63 touch-downs over the past two years, and he has over 4000 pass yards each of the past two years. At one point this season, White had a tremendous stretch where he threw for 5 touchdowns  in consecu-tive games against in-conference foes Charlotte and Old Dominion. However, White and his team lost 5 of their final six games, including their bowl game against Georgia State. The standout quar-terback performed poorly in the postseason, where he led his team to just 17 offensive points against an average Georgia State defense that was ranked 55th in the nation with 25.5 points al-lowed per game. White threw a costly interception late in the fourth quarter that ended the game, and his 31.9 QBR was his second worst rating of all games this season. Scouts must be wondering what version of White will show up in the NFL; his 6 foot 4 inch frame projects well to the next level, but his lack of athleticism and throwing strength are concerns. White should be a late-round pick if he is drafted at all. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Through an analysis of the top ten NFL quarterback prospects who played in bowl games, it is clear that these players did not live up to expectations in postseason play. Overall, these quarter-backs combined for a 2-8 record in bowl season, which shows that they were probably more fo-cused on the NFL than anything else. The only two winners were Josh Allen and Mason Rudolph, the only quarterbacks in the top ten who surpassed their regular season QBRs in postseason play. Also, the average QBR of 48.3 for the top ten quarterbacks in bowl games was significantly lower than their average QBR for the season as a whole, which was 69.0. Although these players are su-premely talented, these prospects clearly have other things on their minds that might be hindering their play. Whether they are thinking of avoiding injury or if they simply don’t care about the game’s result, the numbers support the idea that these players didn’t show the same level of com-mitment as they did in the regular season. 
&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alex Veroulis</name></author><summary type="html">One hot topic for debate among coaches, fans, and analysts who follow college football centers around the role of pro prospects in postseason play (bowl games) and whether or not they should play. This is because several highly-touted players have opted to skip their bowl games to protect their health for their future in the NFL. This trend captures a very small portion of players who de-clare for the NFL Draft, but notable players such as Josh Rosen and Derwin James have skipped their games this year to prevent injuries.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Think Twice Against ESPN Fantasy Projections</title><link href="/thinktwice" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Think Twice Against ESPN Fantasy Projections" /><published>2017-09-19T15:20:51-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-19T15:20:51-07:00</updated><id>/thinktwice</id><content type="html" xml:base="/thinktwice">&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/avg-error.png&quot; alt=graph&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    With the second week of the NFL concluding last night with a 24–10 victory for the Lions over the Giants, I decided to take a look at ESPN fantasy point projection accuracy thus far. 
    ESPN is one of the leading hosts for fantasy football leagues around the country with millions of people trusting their projections to decide which players they should start. After comparing the starting point projections for each week against the actual number of points the player earned, it looks like ESPN has to step up their game.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Having an average error percentage of 98.54%, ESPN projections for defense thus far staggers above any other position. Week 1 especially was awful with an error percentage of 108%! It’s almost as if they are spitting out projected numbers at random! According to FiveThirtyEight, week 1 had the fewest amount of “close” games in NFL history with only 3 games decided by 7 points or fewer, so it makes sense as to why defensive points were so scattered all over the place. To hurt ESPN’s credibility to predict defensive performances further, week 2 was nearly just as bad with an error percentage of 89%. Perhaps, the NFL is trending towards becoming a lopsided league like the MLB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Another interesting statistic to look at besides error percentage is ESPN’s point differential between actual and projected points.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QnSRFkUDKXHGxpBKS8o_qw.png&quot; alt=graph2&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
        Across every position besides a kicker, the point differential hovers around 5 points. For some high scoring positions like a quarter back, and some good running backs, 5 points does not have much of a difference. But, compared to lower scoring positions like defense and tight end, 5 points is precious.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
        Week 2 projection accuracy in both error percentage and point differential was better as the number of blowout games decreased. Fantasy football fans can only hope the accuracy improves each week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
        While there are still 15 weeks left in the season, ESPN projections for defense and a tight end seem to be random guesses as to how they will perform. Surprisingly, quarterback and kicker projections seem to be a fantasy player’s best bet when deciding between who to start. So, for the average Joe fantasy player who only puts in players with a projected high amount of points, you may want to start to think twice and do some personal research!

Since July 23rd, 2017, Clayton Kershaw has not played one game for the Dodgers. Many fans thought the absence of their star pitcher would be devastating to their pace to break the MLB record for best win percentage. While his back injury should of been disastrous, it appears at though the Dodgers are doing just fine without Clayton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since his last game, the Dodgers have been on a tear. With a win percentage of 76.7% over the last 30 games, they have continued to dominate the NL West with a 19 game lead over second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kershaw1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Win percentage&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the date of his injury, the Dodgers were only sitting at a 68.7% win percentage. Shockingly, the rest of the Dodgers pitchers seem unfazed without their leader. When compared against the entire season, the pitching staff seems to be doing at least on par if not better than when Kershaw was active. Looking at the team’s ERA, earned run average, and WHIP, a statistic which tells a pitcher’s propensity for allowing batters to reach base, we see nearly similar numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kershaw2.png&quot; alt=&quot;ERA and WHIP&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 60vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing against all Dodgers who have started at least 3 games, the Dodgers have put up lower ERA and WHIP numbers during Clayton’s absence. So, who is Kershaw’s replacement that’s making this possible? The rest of the regular pitchers are doing great as always, but who has been filling the gap? The answer is Yu Darvish.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kershaw3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yu Darvish&quot; style=&quot;float: left; padding-right: 10px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Recently traded from the Texas Rangers on July 31st, Darvish was just what the Dodgers needed. Since his time for The Blue Crew, he has posted an ERA of 3.13 and WHIP of 1.16. Though he has only played four games, he is producing numbers just on par with the rest of the pitching staff. With a pitching staff still remaining strong, then that leaves the Dodger’s batting for these crazy win percentage numbers. With Turner, Bellinger, Seager, and the gang still beating up on other teams, it appears as though they all consciously making up for the absence of the 3-time Cy Young winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget what Kershaw brings the table. We cannot expect these hitters to continue to perform at this high of caliber through the rest of season and playoffs. While it’s tough to remember, Kershaw was off to another amazing year for the Dodgers in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kershaw4.png&quot; alt=&quot;With and without Kershaw&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why they pay him the big bucks, with a 2.04 ERA and 0.88 WHIP for the Boys in Blue. Kershaw’s impact cannot be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, Manager, Dave Roberts, just reported that Kershaw will be returning to the mound Friday against the Padres. If he’s anything like what he was at the start of the season, it will alleviate a lot of pressure off the batters, and make for a historic rest of a season for the Dodgers.&lt;/p&gt;
