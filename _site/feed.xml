&lt;p&gt;
    With the second week of the NFL concluding last night with a 24–10 victory for the Lions over the Giants, I decided to take a look at ESPN fantasy point projection accuracy thus far. 
    ESPN is one of the leading hosts for fantasy football leagues around the country with millions of people trusting their projections to decide which players they should start. After comparing the starting point projections for each week against the actual number of points the player earned, it looks like ESPN has to step up their game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- end excerpt here --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Having an average error percentage of 98.54%, ESPN projections for defense thus far staggers above any other position. Week 1 especially was awful with an error percentage of 108%! It’s almost as if they are spitting out projected numbers at random! According to FiveThirtyEight, week 1 had the fewest amount of “close” games in NFL history with only 3 games decided by 7 points or fewer, so it makes sense as to why defensive points were so scattered all over the place. To hurt ESPN’s credibility to predict defensive performances further, week 2 was nearly just as bad with an error percentage of 89%. Perhaps, the NFL is trending towards becoming a lopsided league like the MLB.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Another interesting statistic to look at besides error percentage is ESPN’s point differential between actual and projected points.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QnSRFkUDKXHGxpBKS8o_qw.png&quot; alt=graph2&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
        Across every position besides a kicker, the point differential hovers around 5 points. For some high scoring positions like a quarter back, and some good running backs, 5 points does not have much of a difference. But, compared to lower scoring positions like defense and tight end, 5 points is precious.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
        Week 2 projection accuracy in both error percentage and point differential was better as the number of blowout games decreased. Fantasy football fans can only hope the accuracy improves each week.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
        While there are still 15 weeks left in the season, ESPN projections for defense and a tight end seem to be random guesses as to how they will perform. Surprisingly, quarterback and kicker projections seem to be a fantasy player’s best bet when deciding between who to start. So, for the average Joe fantasy player who only puts in players with a projected high amount of points, you may want to start to think twice and do some personal research!
&lt;/p&gt;

Since July 23rd, 2017, Clayton Kershaw has not played one game for the Dodgers. Many fans thought the absence of their star pitcher would be devastating to their pace to break the MLB record for best win percentage. While his back injury should of been disastrous, it appears at though the Dodgers are doing just fine without Clayton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since his last game, the Dodgers have been on a tear. With a win percentage of 76.7% over the last 30 games, they have continued to dominate the NL West with a 19 game lead over second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kershaw1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Win percentage&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the date of his injury, the Dodgers were only sitting at a 68.7% win percentage. Shockingly, the rest of the Dodgers pitchers seem unfazed without their leader. When compared against the entire season, the pitching staff seems to be doing at least on par if not better than when Kershaw was active. Looking at the team’s ERA, earned run average, and WHIP, a statistic which tells a pitcher’s propensity for allowing batters to reach base, we see nearly similar numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kershaw2.png&quot; alt=&quot;ERA and WHIP&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 60vw&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing against all Dodgers who have started at least 3 games, the Dodgers have put up lower ERA and WHIP numbers during Clayton’s absence. So, who is Kershaw’s replacement that’s making this possible? The rest of the regular pitchers are doing great as always, but who has been filling the gap? The answer is Yu Darvish.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kershaw3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Yu Darvish&quot; style=&quot;float: left; padding-right: 10px;&quot;/&gt;Recently traded from the Texas Rangers on July 31st, Darvish was just what the Dodgers needed. Since his time for The Blue Crew, he has posted an ERA of 3.13 and WHIP of 1.16. Though he has only played four games, he is producing numbers just on par with the rest of the pitching staff. With a pitching staff still remaining strong, then that leaves the Dodger’s batting for these crazy win percentage numbers. With Turner, Bellinger, Seager, and the gang still beating up on other teams, it appears as though they all consciously making up for the absence of the 3-time Cy Young winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget what Kershaw brings the table. We cannot expect these hitters to continue to perform at this high of caliber through the rest of season and playoffs. While it’s tough to remember, Kershaw was off to another amazing year for the Dodgers in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kershaw4.png&quot; alt=&quot;With and without Kershaw&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why they pay him the big bucks, with a 2.04 ERA and 0.88 WHIP for the Boys in Blue. Kershaw’s impact cannot be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, Manager, Dave Roberts, just reported that Kershaw will be returning to the mound Friday against the Padres. If he’s anything like what he was at the start of the season, it will alleviate a lot of pressure off the batters, and make for a historic rest of a season for the Dodgers.&lt;/p&gt;
