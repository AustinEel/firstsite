&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell Westbrook has become one of the NBA's top players in the past decade. He has been a marvel to watch, as his thrilling athleticism has allowed him to churn out highlight after highlight. On top of his exhilarating play-style, he has become a fan favorite due to his curt interviews and his redemptive MVP season after Kevin Durant so infamously snaked Russ and the Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, his role as a point guard has drawn some ire from basketball fans. Although point guards are generally defined as floor generals who control the offense of the team, Russ has somewhat defied this tradition, as he plays the position with a ball-dominant style that has limited his efficiency. Currently, Russ leads the league in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stats?season=2017&amp;category=SCORING&amp;group=1&amp;sort=7&amp;time=0&amp;pos=0&amp;team=0&amp;qual=1&amp;sortOrder=0&amp;opp=0&amp;page=1&quot;&gt;field goal attempts&lt;/a&gt; at 21.2 per game, and was the second in the league in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=TOUCHES&amp;dir=1&quot;&gt;touches&lt;/a&gt; at 95.3 per game in the 2017-18 season. As a player with such a high usage, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clutchpoints.com/would-russell-westbrook-have-had-a-better-career-if-he-was-a-shooting-guard/&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; comes up somewhat frequently: would Russ be better as a shooting guard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring a unique perspective to this debate, we decided to tackle it with a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a form of regression that predicts a binary dependent variable from an independent variable or a collection of them. We figured that we could consider the classification of a guard as a point guard or shooting guard as a binary regression problem, and create a model around this. Then, we could run Russ's stats through our model and see what it classifies Russ as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We collected advanced and basic statistics of all guards since the 1979-80 season. We chose the 1979-80 season as the starting point because this was the first season where the 3-point line was introduced; thus, all of the advanced statistics for players from that season onwards are complete. To predict the position, we first included all of the 43 predictors in the logistic model. Next, we removed the highly correlated predictors, then conducted a stepwise variable selection process using AIC as our criterion. We ended up with 14 variables that constituted our new model. To check the accuracy of our new model, we split the data into training and testing sets, then calculated the mean squared error of the predictions of testing data. The result showed that our model was 89% accurate in classifying guards as either point guards or shooting guards. After building the classification model, we applied the model onto Westbrook's statistics for each year to classify his position, and the results proved to be very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;cover photo&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our model classified him as a shooting guard only in the 2011-12 season, which is particularly noteworthy, since this is the only season in his career that one of his teams made the NBA Finals. Thus, we decided to focus our deeper analysis on this season and the 2016-17 season, when he won the MVP award. We also chose to mostly examine his offensive traits, since this is the side of the ball where his status as a guard is contentious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental difference between these two seasons is the team that surrounded Russ. Just take a look at how the Thunder's win shares were distributed over these two seasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, he had a lot more talent surrounding him in 2012 than in 2017. With three future MVPs on the squad in Russ himself, Kevin Durant, and James Harden, the 2012 Thunder team was very stacked, and allowed for a more even distribution of contribution throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any given day, any one of Durant, Harden, or Westbrook could go off and give the opposing defense hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCUwuSwmcck&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allowed for some of the most dynamic basketball we have seen in the last few decades. Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/R_Voow0DDmg?t=228&quot;&gt;this incredible play&lt;/a&gt; from the 2012 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. Here, Harden gets the ball on a swing pass and decides to drive into the teeth of the defense. When he sees three Spurs collapse on him, he sneaks an incredibly difficult skip-pass to an open Russ on the wing. Instead of popping the three, Russ blows by the senior citizen Tony Parker, who has no hope in keeping up. Then, he craftily maneuvers around Tim Duncan's attempted charge to finish an insane layup. While Kevin Durant was not directly involved in this play, his gravity plays a massive role in this layup coming to fruition. Note that as Russ goes in for the layup, Kawhi Leonard has two choices: help on the drive and leave Durant wide open from the arc, or stay home on his man. If he helps, he leaves an elite 3-point shooter wide open; if he doesn't help, he gives an elite penetrator a fairly clear lane (which is what happened in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;SLAM Magazine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having these three players on the floor at once opened up so many avenues of attack for Oklahoma City. Either all three could get involved in the play (which often didn't happen because of Scott Brooks's abysmal coaching, but that's material for another article), or two of them could run a nice two-man game with the floor opened up due to the third player. Also, with three marquee players who could bring the ball up and initiate offense, the Thunder did not have to rely solely on Russ to make something happen every possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Harden and Durant left, this changed dramatically. In his MVP season, Russ's best offensive companions were Enes Kanter, Steven Adams and Victor Oladipo. These players, while good in their own rights, were a far cry from the MVP-calibre talents that were Durant and Harden. As a result, the Thunder ran as Russ ran.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic6.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we see here, Westbrook shared a relatively larger piece of the pie for his team in points, assists, and rebounds in 2017 than in 2012. Also, between the two seasons, his assist percentage (the percentage of teammate field goals a player assisted while he was on the floor) nearly doubled, from 29.8% in 2012 to 57.3% in 2017. His usage percentage also increased, but not as dramatically (32.7% to 41.7%). Still, his 41.7% usage good enough to be the highest mark in the league that season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the team to be successful, they had to feed the ball to Russ and let him work his magic. In many ways, this philosophy did work. Watching Russ run the fast-break was (and still is) an absolute delight. Often, Kanter and Adams would either grab rebounds, or box out opponents so that Russ himself could get the ball. Then, Russ would streak down the floor, display some supreme ball-handling talents and either &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Dtb10PeLF2s?t=85&quot;&gt;lay it in with ease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Jmc4KMDs2CA?t=64&quot;&gt;smash in a scintillating dunk&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being a lethal scorer on the fast-break, Russ also had great vision in transition, where he could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rnCCLRMK-8&quot;&gt;weave the ball through nearly impossible passing lanes&lt;/a&gt; when his team got running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the half-court, Russ also utilized some excellent tools. With his big men, Adams and Kanter, Russ often ran the pick-and-roll, where he could either &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/paJ85RCJDh4?t=1431&quot;&gt;find one of them on the roll&lt;/a&gt; or finish himself, either on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/paJ85RCJDh4?t=84&quot;&gt;mid-range pull-up&lt;/a&gt; that he has mastered or on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/paJ85RCJDh4?t=194&quot;&gt;layup/dunk in the paint&lt;/a&gt;. His vision also assisted him in the half-court game, where he could &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3KLWle7B8wo?t=65&quot;&gt;find his teammates cutting backdoor with slick passes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic7.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Steven Adams, Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2016-17 season, Russ famously averaged a triple double, won the MVP award and lead the Thunder to 47 wins, keeping his team in the playoff hunt after Kevin Durant left the team in cowardly fashion the previous offseason. However, while they had relative success with Russ at the helm, the Thunder also suffered at the hands of their star. As anyone who watches Westbrook with any regularity knows, he is not always the best decision maker on the floor, as he often barrels into the rim for &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9TO4yjEfMUg?t=76&quot;&gt;reckless shots&lt;/a&gt;, turns the ball over in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GnJ7xe-2MY&quot;&gt;extraordinary fashion&lt;/a&gt; or generally just does &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jz9M4LIRD0&quot;&gt;things that should not be done on a basketball court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9TO4yjEfMUg?t=47&quot;&gt;This play&lt;/a&gt; encapsulates many of the criticisms of Russell Westbrook. As the play sets up, you can see some nice action off the ball, as Alex Abrines cuts towards the basket at the top of the key off a nice screen. He is clearly looking at Russ, expecting him to slip the ball in for either an easy layup or a kick-out to Jerami Grant if Klay Thompson helped one pass away. Instead, Russ barrels into the basket and takes an ill-advised layup on three Warriors that gets swatted into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russ's boneheaded decisions certainly hurt his stock as a point guard. Even in his incredible MVP season, while had quite a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raDYzXmmQEA&quot;&gt;memorable late-game moments&lt;/a&gt;, he also had an equal amount of not-so-memorable late-game moments, where he would miss deep, off-balance 3s and heavily contested layups when better shots were available. Though he was the reason OKC won the majority of their games, he was also often the reason they lost the games they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5iRmnl4mpU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And as we saw, a team that lived by the Russ and died by the Russ petered out in the first round of the playoffs, losing to James Harden's Rockets in five games. When he was forced to be the ultimate floor general, he stuffed the stat sheet for himself, but his team did not do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic8.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, he did not have two other MVPs by his side. And, a lot of his decision-making woes existed even in the season when he played more of a &quot;shooting guard&quot; role (according to our model). After Game 2 of the 2012 NBA Finals, when Russ chucked up 26 shots in a loss, Magic Johnson famously called Russ &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thebiglead.com/2017/08/10/magic-johnson-on-russell-westbrook-in-2012-finals-worst-point-guard-in-nba-finals-history/&quot;&gt;the worst point guard in a Championship Finals&lt;/a&gt;&quot; he had ever seen. While his teammates Durant and Harden had 32 and 21 on 54.5% and 63.6% shooting (respectively), Russ only shot 38.4% from the field. For obvious reasons, Magic was angry at the fact that the Russ kept on shooting on an off night instead of feeding the hot hands, as a point guard should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps those numbers would be easier to stomach if he weren't playing the role of a floor general. Most volume scorers have nights of inefficiency, but also have more leeway in terms of shooting themselves back into the game, since scoring is their main offensive role. However, elite point guards who are expected to run their offense with gravitas and poise should engage their hot players, especially when they are in shooting slumps. Maybe if Russ stuck to the role closer to a shooting guard after the 2011-12 season, he might have been able to hone his scoring skills and avoid the brunt of learning how to become a better facilitator on offense. With a more off-ball role, he could have risen to even higher highs than he already has in his great career. And possibly, if he had done these things, he could have &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779267-kevin-durant-on-2016-free-agency-meeting-with-warriors-i-needed-that-validation&quot;&gt;convinced Kevin Durant to stay&lt;/a&gt; in Oklahoma City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it might not be too late to fall back on his shooting guard roots. As a point guard, his offense relies heavily on his explosive athleticism. Our classification model shows that as age increases, the proportion of point guards in each age group decreases. After 28 years old, which is around the peak of players' athleticism, guards are more likely to be shooting guards (Russ is 30 years old right now, FYI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic9.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russ passes the peak of his athleticism, his offensive efficiency might decrease if he continues to play the way he does now. Russ possess the qualities to become a good off-ball player, as we saw in his relatively successful 2011-12 &quot;shooting guard&quot; season. Looking more currently, his catch-and-shoot scoring has been improving over the past few years. According to NBA.com, in the 2017-18 season, Russ ranked in the 87.6th percentile in spot-up shooting, with 1.16 points per possession. However, this play-type only made up 4.7% of Westbrook's offensive plays last season. Given his offensive awareness and off-ball scoring ability, if he tries to play more off-ball at the shooting guard position, it might be more efficient for him as a scorer and beneficial for the team.  Even though Kevin Durant and James Harden aren't walking through that door again, OKC has an All-Star in Paul George, a capable point guard in Dennis Schroder, a tank in Steven Adams, a four who is better than Melo in Jerami Grant, and more. The squad has a lot of potential, and Russ can potentially unlock that potential by shifting his play-style a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/russ/pic6.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Layne Murdoch, Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fellow Bruins, we love Russ and want him to succeed more than anything. It would be so heartwarming if Russ could get over the hump of the first round of the playoffs that he hasn't been able to conquer without Durant at his side. He won the MVP award without Durant; now it's time for him to win in the playoffs without him.&lt;/p&gt;

Each year, the highest ranked teams from all European leagues automatically qualify or enter the preliminary stages of this tournament. In the end, 32 teams participate in a grueling group stage, where every team plays each other twice. The top two teams from all 8 groups make the first knockout stage. Each knockout matchup has two games, other than the final which has one. As a result, the UCL format generally ensures that the team who wins must consistently play well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To win the UCL, a team must have a strategy that is effective enough to overcome the lengthy group stage, three 2-legged knockout ties, and a high-pressure final match against another top team. Over the years, no system has been as romanticized as one that is possession-based. Teams such as the Netherlands national team of the 70s, the World Cup-winning Spanish national team, and Barcelona in the 21st century have been famed for their successful application of this strategy. More recently, Manchester City has dominated the English Premier League with coach Pep Guardiola, renowned for this system, at the helm. In this article, I will attempt to analyze if a play style centered around possession is truly the best method for guaranteeing success in the UCL. Statistics from the 2017-18 edition of the competition will be used for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Real Madrid celebrates their third UCL title in a row - Source: Fox Sports&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measuring Performance of All Teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key for &quot;Stage Reached&quot; Variable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before analysis can be performed, there must be a variable present to measure the level of success of teams in the competition. As a result, a quantitative variable is created to indicate the progression of a club. As indicated by the table above, any value equal to or greater than 3 demonstrates that a team qualified for the knockout stage of the 2017-18 UEFA Champions League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possession percentage is the most basic way of modeling a team's strategy. The histogram shows that the possession splits of sides will generally remain closer to 50/50, especially as teams in the competition are generally of comparable ability. However, being at or above a possession percentage of 50 seems to almost ensure a knockout round place. Every team that made the quarter-finals, other than Juventus, had at least a percentage of 50. On the other hand, a clear outlier is Benfica, who finished last in their group with a 54.7% possession per game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparison between Chelsea and Benfica demonstrates how play style is not the sole deciding factor in team success. Chelsea averaged 47.2% possession per game but scored 2.1 goals per game, whereas Benfica had a measly average of 0.2 goals per game. What this proves is that retaining the ball for the majority of the match means nothing unless a team is able to create and finish opportunities. In theory, greater possession should translate to more chances created, which would lead to more goals being scored. However, the case of Benfica, who finished the group stage with 6 losses in 6 matches, demonstrates that a team's finishing ability also plays a large part in their potential success. Furthermore, the correlation between possession and team success tapers off as the competition progresses. This hints at the notion that teams who can retain the ball well are able to fend off weaker teams, but are not ensured victory against stronger opposition. This is understandable, as top clubs and top players are able to create chances with less opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick look at the relationship between the amount of shots taken and the stage reached shows that there is not a very high correlation between taking shots and winning matches, as many teams are averaging similar numbers of shots while reaching different stages of the competition. Clearly, both the quality of the shots a team takes and the finishing capabilities of the players must impact the level of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/possStyle/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, finishing remains a vital part of the game. No team who scored one goal or less made it out of the group stage. Teams who are making the later stages are also scoring more in general. However, as with the analysis of possession percentages, the correlation weakens as the competition progresses towards the knockouts. Performing well in these categories seems to indicate that a team should progress out of the groups, but not necessarily that they will last much longer. The two outliers on the high scoring end of the spectrum are Liverpool, who was a finalist, and PSG, who went out in the first knockout stage. Still, the opposite is not true, as teams who are reaching the latter stages must be performing adequately in terms of these statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyzing the Performance of the Finalists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final of the 2017-18 UCL, Real Madrid and Liverpool faced off in what turned out to be the former's third straight title, a truly astonishing feat. Real Madrid came in with a squad teeming with experienced stars. Their preferred midfield trio of Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, and Casemiro continually dominated the opposition with their intelligent movement and creative passing. Liverpool found success due to their high-octane offense, featuring speedy players such as Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table above displays some interesting points of data. Real Madrid ranks 11th in the number of long balls per game, whereas Liverpool ranks 3rd. This is the one passing statistic in the table that is generally known to have an adverse effect on the overall possession of a team, as long-range passing is riskier and carries a lower rate of success. Furthermore, Liverpool falls out of the top 10 in three of the primary possession statistics. These trends demonstrate that Liverpool ignored the allure of a possession-based style in favor of a fast-paced system. They were clearly effective as well, as the team placed similarly to Real Madrid in the rankings for goals and created shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possession-based play style remains a viable option for a team searching for a fruitful strategy, but there is only a certain stage a concentration on this strategy can take a club. Weaker teams can be defeated through dedication to this style, but stronger sides will be able to counterattack more effectively. As a result, knockout round success is difficult to predict based on the metrics provided in this article alone. There is no consistent &quot;winning formula&quot; for success in the Champions League, which is a testament to the difficulty that comes with winning the competition. For the knockout stages, teams must find a system that works best for the players they have. Possession was the primary focus of this article, but deeper studies of counterattacking and defensive approaches would allow for a better understanding of what is truly the best strategy for succeeding in the UCL.&lt;/p&gt;

Each year, the highest ranked teams from all European leagues automatically qualify or enter the preliminary stages of this tournament. In the end, 32 teams participate in a grueling group stage, where every team plays each other twice. The top two teams from all 8 groups make the first knockout stage. Each knockout matchup has two games, other than the final which has one.

	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;excerptpics&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;cover photo&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ray Lewis Ravens, '85 Bears, and Belichick Giants are some of the greatest defenses the National Football League has ever seen. They were stone walls, high-powered, and champions. Scoring more than ten points against any of these teams was an accomplishment- a win in and of itself. However, scoring less than twenty against any team nowadays is almost always another notch in the loss column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern NFL is chock full of defenses who fail to rise to the occasion, ushering in an era of high powered offense and high scoring games. No matter the reasons for this phenomenon (although we'll get to that later), the transition is apparent and an undeniable fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Rams put this trend on display when the two teams combined for 105 points, 1001 yards, and 56 first downs. This would be absolutely shocking for the football world only a few decades ago. Although that particular scoreline is still the largest of the season, games including Chiefs-Patriots, Saints-Buccaneers, and Browns-Raiders all had score totals of 83, 88, and 87 respectively. As of week 12, games are averaging a record 48.4 total points per game. Even more impressively, four of the seventeen highest scoring games in NFL history have come this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total offensive points have increased dramatically over the last 60 years as indicated by the graph below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;*The 2018 season is ongoing, thus showing a smaller overall value than previous years.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what is causing this apparent lapse in defensive ability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One argument centers around NFL rules and officiating. A sudden emphasis on the roughing the passer rule this year has resulted in defensive players displaying caution around the quarterback, allowing offenses to take advantage of the hesitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prominent example was displayed in primetime when Chiefs linebacker Breeland Speaks let go of Tom Brady after having two arms around him because he &quot;*thought the ball was gone&quot; and did not want to risk getting a penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYVVmrdv54o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Various NFL defensive players have expressed frustration with this type of officiating. Star Saints Defensive End Cameron Jordan stated that in order to sack a quarterback without receiving a penalty, you must &quot;**put a pillow underneath his head [and] read him a bedtime story.&quot; Hyperbole aside, the numbers seem to back up his sentiment. Even though the &quot;roughing the passer&quot; part of the rule book was completely left alone this offseason, the frequency of the penalty has increased 65% in the first six weeks of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, a series of rule adjustments that favor receivers in the open field, including the protections of defenseless players and an increased emphasis on defensive pass interference, have also most likely resulted in an increased ability for offenses to earn yards and score. If we take a look at the table below, the ratio of Defensive Pass Interference calls to total pass attempts has narrowed every single year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defensive Pass Interference in the NFL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, defenses around the league might just be really bad. There are plenty examples already this season of defensive players making low effort tackles on runners in the open field, resulting in tremendously long plays and touchdowns. For example, in the Dolphins' game against the Bears in Week 6, quarterback Brock Osweiler threw 380 yards and three touchdowns. This is interesting, considering that all but one of his completions came within 15 yards of the line of scrimmage. This means that most of his total passing yards came from yards after the catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;*source: nfl.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visualization above is a representation of Brock Osweiler's game against the Bears. It displays how far away from the line of scrimmage the receiver catches the ball, disregarding yards after the catch. According to the key, all three of his touchdown passes came from completions within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage. One of these touchdowns was a 43 yard completion over the middle with three missed tackles by Bears defenders in the open field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_lzD_jr1HE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Kansas City Chiefs' record-setting 10-game streak of scoring a touchdown of 50 yards or longer has exposed just how bad defenses are this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and most potentially potent theory revolves around the gradual transition from run-heavy games to passing gameplans. The switch from majority running to majority passing teams came over 30 years ago when elite quarterbacks rose up to produce far more yards than were previously possible. However, the uptick has not yet stopped, and offenses are still moving more and more away from the run. The graph below displays the number of first downs achieved by each team per game. The trendlines shown have r-values of 0.89 and 0.84 for passing and running respectively, strong linear correlations dictating associations between the years that have passed and the rates of first downs according to these different methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nflDef/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;*source: nfl.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing in the NFL, in conjunction with the aforementioned rule changes that favor passing, are creating high-scoring and high-yardage games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, defenses are struggling constantly now, and it has become rarer and rarer for them to be successful against modern, high-powered offenses. All important offensive metrics, total yards, total points, and first downs all point towards offenses reaching all-time highs in these categories this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The causes of this phenomenon are three-fold: nfl officiating, limited ability, and a transition from run to pass. The league is changing in what aspects of the game it values, and offense is at the top. It is no surprise as well that NFL ratings are up 5% this year for the first time in over six years. These high-scoring games, while mostly a spectacle of fast playmakers running up and down the field, are very entertaining to the general public. While football purists might be barking on Sportscenter about a return to &quot;real&quot; football, this new game will be the NFL for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most acclaimed of these leagues is the Cape Cod Baseball League, which consists of 10 teams across the Cape Cod peninsula. Collegiate summer leagues have support from both Major League Baseball and the NCAA, and are intended to help advance players from the collegiate to professional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of October 2015, 1155 past players from the Cape Cod Baseball League had made an appearance in at least one MLB game. Some veterans in this group include household names like Rich Hill, Chase Utley, and George Springer. Looking at the Boston Red Sox 2018 World Series Roster, 8 out of 25 players, including World Series MVP Steve Pearce, participated in the Cape Cod Baseball League. There are more veterans of this summer league on the Boston Red Sox than any other major league team. When Chris Sale played for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox in 2009, he was third in ERA and recorded the most strikeouts throughout the season. Could there be a correlation between performance in summer leagues like the CCBL and professional success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep it simple, we'll focus on batting performance as an indicator of potential in the MLB. With the wide acceptance of advanced analytics in baseball, more attention has been placed on batting statistics like slugging and on-base percentage, as opposed to the unreliable statistic of batting average. Slugging and on-base percentage are more precise and accurate measurements for offensive production; they reward batters who make it on base and thus those who create more scoring opportunities. OPS combines these two statistics into one. Although this stat unfairly weighs OBP and SLG as equal (and according to Fangraphs, OBP is about 1.8 times more important than SLG), OPS still paints an accurate picture of a player's offensive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the collegiate and professional levels, a high mark in this category indicates tremendous offensive power. Accordingly, players in the Cape Cod Baseball League who eclipse their teammates and opponents in offensive categories have a promising future. Let's look at the top batting performers in the CCBL from 2004-2013 and analyze how the performance of eventual professional players compares to the top performers in the years they played on the Cape.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/sumBall/pic1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the graph above, OPS is plotted against the number of RBIs for the top 10 batters of each season of the CCBL from 2004 to 2013. The blue dots represent the players who achieved tremendous success in the MLB; these players include Jason Kipnis, Buster Posey, and Jackie Bradley Jr. A trend line for the professional players models the positive relationship between the number of RBIs and OPS. For every increase in OPS by .041, players are predicted to get an RBI. The blue dots tend to be clustered close to the regression line and the eventual MLBers who did well in the CCBL had more than 20 RBIs and an OPS higher than 0.900.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's obvious that the eventual pros did not blow away their competitors in offensive production. However, there does seem to be a balance between OPS and RBIs that makes a player excel beyond the collegiate level. Let's use the regression line for the eventual MLB players to see how players from the 2018 season of the CCBL compare.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/sumBall/pic2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive relationship between OPS and RBI remains, but there are only a handful of players with more than 20 RBIs and an OPS over .900. Let's look at some of the players from last year's CCBL that meet these criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2018 season of the Cape Cod League, Austin Shenton of the Wareham Gatemen was third in batting with an average of .349 and an OPS of .940. Last year at Florida International University, he batted an astounding .344 with OPS of .941. Shenton was named the Postseason MVP for the CCBL 2018 playoffs as he lead the Wareham Gatemen to the championship. D1Baseball predicted he would be a breakout player this summer. They also detailed Shenton's incredibly mental approach to the game which no doubt had an impact on his performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranked above Shenton in CCBL batting average was Matthew Barefoot of the Hyannis Harbor Hawks who lead the league with a whopping .379.He also led the league with a .474 OBP, reaching base on almost half of his plate appearances. In 2017, Barefoot batted .335 with OPS of .937 for Campbell University and he helped propel the team into the spring NCAA tournament. With little expertise on defense, Barefoot may struggle to get to the majors. However, his batting performance was sure to get the scouts' attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we'll look at Noah Campbell from the University of South Carolina. He crushed the Cape Cod Baseball League with a .636 slugging percentage, that's .063 more than the next closest player. He was also third in the league with an on-base percentage of of .456. At South Carolina last year, Campbell batted .286 with OPS of .752. He doesn't boast the highest batting average, but his immense power hitting ability blows everyone else away. Aside from a finger injury last March, there is little doubt surrounding Campbell. He is a force both offensively and defensively and has unquestionable potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in his season in the Cape Cod Baseball League, World Series Champion Jackie Bradley Jr. was impressive with 14 RBIs and a .717 OPS, yet he didn't outshine his competitors offensively. He didn't outperform our highlighted 2018 CCBL players either. However, with his relentless work ethic, Bradley made it to the major leagues and was the definition of clutch in this past world Series. He possessed that x-factor needed to excel in professional baseball. Shenton, Barefoot, and Campbell undoubtedly have the offensive power to do damage in the MLB, and their work ethics show promise for professional success.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Haley Rao</name></author><summary type="html">Every summer, hundreds of college baseball players participate in summer leagues around the country.

After missing the playoffs for blank consecutive years, the Lakers look to make a playoff run and possibly contend for a championship title with the addition of the NBA's most prominent star. In addition to Lebron James, the Lakers added notable veterans such as Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Lance Stephenson. However, the Lakers remain at their core a very young team, with blossoming players with high potentials. These young players who look to be the future of the franchise are Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball. In this article, I will focus on these young players, analyzing their individual game log data I retrieved from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.basketball-reference.com/&quot;&gt;Basketball-Reference.com&lt;/a&gt; and using John Hollinger's Game Score statistic as a metric in determining the success each player had the last 2017-18 season in each game they played in. Game Score is a more complex metric that was designed to roughly estimate the success of a player's single game. If you are interested in knowing how Game Score is exactly calculated, you can find the informaion in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/game-score/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. My goal in analyzing this data is to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each player from the perspective of exactly how each succeeded relative to their average performances of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why GameScore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the choice of analyzing the young core's strengths and weaknesses through the lens of GameScore based upon GameScore's reptuable history and also based upon a convenience standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Hollinger, the man who devised the formula for GameScore, is known as an early leader of basketball analytics, and is currently the Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Memphis Grizzlies. To verify the accuracy of Gamescore as a metric for individual success, I found that two of the most iconic individual performances, Michael Jordan's 69 point, 18 rebound game against Cleveland in 1990 and Kobe Bryant's 81 point game against Toronto in 2006, were the highest GameScores since 1983.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, Basketball-Reference.com provides individual player boxscore data with GameScore included. Thus, GameScore became both a logical and convenient choice to use as a measurement of individual success for the young Lakers core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploring the Data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start my stastical analyisis, I began by exploring the data. First, we can take a quick look at the distributions of Game Score for each player, as well as comparing the mean Game Score for each player in the following charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;lonzowire.usatoday.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these histograms, we can notice that the distribution of the Game Score's were roughly similiar to normal distributions with the exception of outliers. We want to capture what the greatest predictors are of each individual's Game Score relative to their own average performance on the year. In other words, we want to find out exactly what that player did exceptionally well or exceptionally poorly to merit a good or bad game score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above chart we can see the average Game Scores for each player for the 2017-2018 season. Visually, we can see that the young core all have about the same average Game Scores, with the exception of Hart, who played the least amount of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methodology and Rationale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a statistical standpoint, my primary methodology predicting the Game Score statstic using variables from the game logs as my predictive variables through a multiple linear regression model. The rationale behind choosing such a model is for interperatable purposes, as it is clear from the output of this model the effects of each variable in predicting the statistic Game Score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An essential part of building these models is the question of normalizing the data. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to normalize by individual since this will tell us what the individual should work on more for their own personal game, not compared to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the models, I tested the subsets up to a total of five predictors through an exhaustive search, choosing the model with the highest adjusted R2. If you are interested in learning more about the models built or datasets you can visit the datasets and code on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jgyee/BSA-Young-Lakers-Data-Game-Score-Analysis&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. The following charts below summarize my results for these models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/youngC/pic5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding the Keys to Success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us now break up the models and analyze each separately, giving recommendations to each player their &quot;keys to success&quot;, and what parts of their game they should work on more, basing our suggestions on the coefficients of the models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Hart, his field goal atempts most drastically affects his Gamescore negatively relative to his fellow teammates, meaning he should &lt;b&gt;focus on better shot attempts&lt;/b&gt;. The other coefficients of Hart's model rank all fairly high compared to the rest of the young core, alluding to Hart's strong overall game and lack of offensive deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Kuzma, his turnovers most adversely affect his Gamescore negatively in comparison to the other players, meaning he should focus on being more careful with the ball. In addition, his field goal attempts do not dramatically decrease his Gamescore compared to his fellow teammates. These two factors may be indicative of Kuzma &lt;b&gt;continuing to be aggressive shooting the ball&lt;/b&gt;, but to temper that aggression with more patience when driving or passing, which can lead to costly turnovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ingram, his field goals most positively improve his performance, so he should focus on staying aggressive and &lt;b&gt;being a primary scoring option&lt;/b&gt;. His free throw coefficient is lagging behind that of Kuzma and Hart. To improve, he can focus on drawing more fouls and get to the line more. Additionally, he can &lt;b&gt;improve his free throw percentage&lt;/b&gt;, so that when he does get to the line, he converts those attempts into points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ball, his assists and steals most positively affect his Gamescore relative to the other three players. Unsurprisingly, Lonzo's passing is the strongest part of his game and contributes to the majority of his success in his best games. For him to succeed, he must &lt;b&gt;keep his assists up&lt;/b&gt;, maintain aggressive on defensive possessions, as well as &lt;b&gt;improve on his scoring ability.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking across the various models, we have noticed some differences between the players. These results are somewhat suprising, as they give us a different perspective than looking at a player's overall season statistics, such as Josh Hart's 47% FG% on the season telling us that he is an efficient scorer. This compared to Lonzo Ball's shockingly-low 36% FG% from last season. However, we must keep in mind that these statistics are normalized, so they are adjusted for in respect to that player's average performance. This is the key lens of our models we must look through in order to interpret and know why the results are the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion and Further Remarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two key aspects of our analysis that differentiate it from the typical, more basic analysis of a player's performance. From the perspective of looking at singular games rather than a whole season, we can find different results that may give us deeper insight into the success of these players solely on a game-to-game basis. Addtionally, choosing to normalize based on that player's own performances, we can see statistical differences in their own games rather than comparing it to a metric of other players, such as league averages for box-score statistics. I hope by reaading this article, you have gained some extra insight into the games of the Young Lakers Core. If you wish to read more about further remarks and potential pitfalls, please check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jgyee/BSA-Young-Lakers-Data-Game-Score-Analysis&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Justin Yee</name></author><summary type="html">With Lebron coming to Los Angeles, the expectations surrounding the Lakers havent't been this high since the Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard, and Steve Nash team-up. After missing the playoffs for blank consecutive years, the Lakers look to make a playoff run and possibly contend for a championship title with the addition of the NBA's most prominent star. In addition to Lebron James, the Lakers added notable veterans such as Rajon Rondo, Javale McGee, and Lance Stephenson. However, the Lakers remain at their core a very young team, with blossoming players with high potentials.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Do Summary Statistics Really Mean Anything in Tennis?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/summaryStatisticsTennis" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Do Summary Statistics Really Mean Anything in Tennis?" /><published>2018-12-01T14:53:33-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-01T14:53:33-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/summaryStatisticsTennis</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/summaryStatisticsTennis">&lt;p&gt;Four times a year, the entire tennis community gathers to witness one of the most spectacular events: The Grand Slams. Fans young and old crowd around laptops and televisions, host watch parties with friends, and some even witness the magic in person if lucky enough. From watching new upcomers like Denis Shapovalov and Borna Coric, to legends such as Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, each match is always fun to watch. Of course, just like with every other sport, debating and betting about who will win each match in casual settings as well as in fantasy draws is a crucial part of the entire experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in determining these winners, many people use blind intuition, flip a coin or pick the players they know. We all have that one friend who sees the 26th seed with a record for the most double faults and puts them in the finals of their fantasy draw. But for every ten people using this technique, there is one savvy person looking for data metrics and statistics to help them pick a winner. Tennis data can be obtained from various places, with little to no information of the accuracy of the data. Still, there are clearly reliable, verified sites such at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/ stats/1701.html?promo=matchchanger&quot;&gt;IBM SlamTracker data&lt;/a&gt;, which is the site from which this data was obtained. However, there is no real indication for the person trying to predict the winner of a match whether these statistics actually matter, or which statistics matter more than others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/summTennis/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The 2018 Men's Tennis U.S. Open Trophy (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/376965431287972606/&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this article, we look at match data for every single match in U.S. Open 2018 and analyze the summary statistics of the winner of every match to see if they are good predictors of winning matches. If they are, we can further analyze these summary statistics to see if we can find the most accurate predictor of winning matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/summTennis/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first graph is a bar graph of the % occurrence of each summary statistic in a winning match. The first important thing to take note of is the y-axis, where the percentages are displayed. What is very important to note is that it starts at 50%, meaning that there is always a greater percentage of matches where the winner is leading in every single summary statistic. This is very important, as it tells us that all of these summary stats are relevant and do actually factor in predicting a winner. Beyond that, we can take a look at each of the summary statistics, and see which one is the most accurate predictor in determining the winner of a match. Looking at the bar graph, it is clear that &quot;more receiving points won&quot; is the most important category (91.34%). Obviously this makes sense; most professional tennis players hold serve with relative ease, whereas &quot;breaking serve&quot;, or winning the serve games of opponents, is what changes the actual outcome of the match. Another important measurement to note is the percent occurrence of the aggressive versus the defensive measurements, and what that says about the data. For example, when comparing the aggressive measurements such as the &quot;more aces&quot; and &quot;more winners&quot; categories and the defensive measurements such as &quot;less double faults&quot; and &quot;less unforced errors&quot;, it is clear that a greater percentage of the winning matches contain aggressive statistics than defensive statistics. This is very important, because it contradicts the &quot;defense is the best Offense&quot; theory. It suggests the importance of being a more aggressive player, and gives way to a range of possible topics to explore, in the context of the benefits of an offensive or a defensive playing style. We can analyze these summary statistics further, as we take a look at the filtered version showing results for only Novak Djokovic, the winner of the 2018 U.S. Open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/summTennis/pic2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Novak Djokovic, as the winner of the tournament, would have won all of his matches: because of this, his data would follow the data for the summary statistics (which we have determined as a good predictors to some extent). Djokovic's data presents an interesting contrast to the previous observations: his defensive qualities show up more. The 3 most offensive statistics (more aces, higher 1st serve % in, and more winners) show up the least in all the metrics, which confounds with the data accumulated from the winner of every single match. We can take the future research options we were looking into before (the usefulness of offense vs. defense) and narrow our focus, seeing if there is a difference between general victors and the champions of each tournament in terms of playing style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/summTennis/pic3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Novak Djokovic, champion of the 2018 U.S Open (https://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/2018-06-21-im-not-one-of-wimbledon-favourites-insists-novak-djokovic/)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is clear that the data being collected for the matches, rather than just a measure of a given player in a given match, allows us to make some sort of an insightful decision on the winner of a match. Using the sample size of one tournament, of course, is too small to see how accurate of a predictor the summary statistics are, but it does provide an indication that these summary statistics can be useful when drawing inferences. In the future, we have many new avenues of research that open up to us. We could expand the observations to include every single tournament of 2017, and see if those summary statistics played a factor in shaping the results of 2018. We could also compare general winners to the tournament champion, and see if winning the tournaments comes from a different playing style or outperforming the other players in the same playing style. At least we know there is one thing to take note of: listening to that one friend who has a gut feeling that the player who has the most double faults will win the tournament isn't such a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gautham Pasupathy</name></author><summary type="html">Four times a year, the entire tennis community gathers to witness one of the most spectacular events&amp;#58; The Grand Slams.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a debate that pervades all cultures, ages and creeds. From every barbershop to lunch table in the world, the question rings: what is your best all-time starting five? Who can construct the best lineup to put on the hardwood using any player from any time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a question that will never have a definitive answer, unless we somehow found the ability to travel through time. We could always do NBA 2K simulations, but we all know about how dubious that game is in mirroring real-life basketball scenarios. The argument is also almost entirely subjective, since there is no definitive consensus on a ranking of NBA players throughout history. Your dream lineup could wildly differ from someone else's based on when you grew up watching basketball, your affinity for statistical analyses of players versus the eye test, a preference of offense over defense (or vice versa), or many other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured that I would bring a novel approach to the age-old question by tackling it with some machine learning concepts. K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that aims to find k groups in unlabeled data based on feature similarity. Each group, or cluster, that the algorithm creates has a centroid, whose features define each cluster. Thus, each point in the data is grouped based on minimal distance from one of the k centroids. An example of an interesting application of the algorithm is using it to group NBA players with comparable play-styles based on their statistical similarities, as done &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastbreakdata.com/classifying-the-modern-nba-player-with-machine-learning-539da03bb824&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to take it a step further; instead of using all NBA players, what if we only clustered a subset of the absolute best NBA players, then chose players from our clusters of player types to come up with an optimal all-time starting lineup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I scraped basic and advanced statistics from basketball-reference.com from the 1979-80 to the 2017-18 seasons. I used these seasons because the 1979-80 season was the first season where the 3-point line was introduced; thus, all of the advanced statistics for players from that season onwards are complete. Then, I scraped a list of 905 All-Stars from the same range of seasons and matched them up to their season statistics. My rationale in using only the All-Stars for this analysis was to only have the best of the best available for me to ultimately choose my lineup from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data had 40 variables, which would have been too many features to use for clustering due to the potential of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visiondummy.com/2014/04/curse-dimensionality-affect-classification/&quot;&gt;overfitting&lt;/a&gt; (the model would take into account all of the specific kinks in our data). By principal components analysis, I reduced the 40 variables down to 3; these 3 variables explained 62.42% of the variance in the data. While most would generally reduce the data down to 2 components, the first 2 principal components only explained 49.87% of the variance in the data in this case. Thus, I decided to use an extra component to carry out clustering, even if that meant possibly overfitting the data to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then ran the k-means algorithm on the data. I decided on an optimal number of clusters of 7 via silhouette scores, which tell us how close a given point in a cluster is to its neighboring clusters. Since we want the clusters to be partitioned well, we want clusters to be further away from neighboring clusters, and therefore want a high average silhouette score, which was achieved with 7 clusters. Here is a visualization of the clusters in a 3-dimensional space, plotted based on the 3 principal components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kmeansAll/pic_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The algorithm partitioned the players into 7 cluster of sizes 186, 115, 153, 75, 139, 95, and 142. These clusters measured 70.9% of the variance in the data (between sum of squares/total sum of squares ratio). I decided to look through the players in each cluster to get a sense of the kinds of players that the algorithm grouped together. Also, to help understand the clusters better, I found the players closest to the centroid of each cluster (through minimum Euclidean distance) to see which kinds of players were closest to the defining features of that cluster. Here are my summarized results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cluster 1: Either Not There Yet, or Already Been There&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closest-to-Centroid: &lt;i&gt;Eddie Johnson (1981)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Players: &lt;i&gt;Allen Iverson (2009), Carmelo Anthony (2015-17), Clyde Drexler (1986, 93-94, 96), Dennis Johnson (1980-82, 85), Dwyane Wade (2014, 16), Isiah Thomas (1982, 87-92, 93), Jason Kidd (1998, 2000-02, 04, 08), Joe Johnson (2007-11, 14), John Wall (2014-16), Kobe Bryant (1998, 2016), Kyrie Irving (2013-14), Julius Erving (1986-87)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cluster features a lot of players who were either young at the time and had not quite reached their apex (such as younger versions of Kobe, Isiah Thomas and Kyrie Irving) or old and declining (such as Dr. J and Allen Iverson in their last few seasons, and the Carmelo Anthony of recent years). Still, there are some pretty great players here, like Jason Kidd and Isiah Thomas in their respective primes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cluster 2: Cream of the Crop Big Men&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closest-to-Centroid: Annalittucks, Erneh!!!!!! (&lt;i&gt;Charles Barkley, 1995&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Players: &lt;i&gt;Anthony Davis (2014, 17-18), Charles Barkley (1987-90, 92-93, 95-96), David Robinson (1990-96, 98, 2000), Hakeem Olajuwon (1985-90, 92-96), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1980-83, 85), Karl Malone (1988-89, 91-98, 2000), Kevin Garnett (2003-06), Moses Malone (1981-83, 85), Patrick Ewing (1989-92, 94), Shaquille O'Neal (1993-96, 98, 2000, 03-06), Tim Duncan (1998, 2000-05, 07)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here is a cluster with some exciting results. The common thread that connects this group is fairly obvious: very high-quality big guys. You really couldn't go wrong with any choice here, as there are tons of dominant, MVP-caliber behemoths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cluster 3: Not-as-Good Big Men&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closest-to-Centroid: &lt;i&gt;Marques Johnson (1986)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Players: &lt;i&gt;Amar'e Stoudemire (2009-11), Blake Griffin (2011-13), Chris Bosh (2006-08, 10-12), Chris Webber (2000-02), Jack Sikma (1981-85), James Worthy (1981, 86-89, 90), Jermaine O'Neal (2002-05, 07), Joel Embiid (2018), Kevin McHale (1984, 89-91), Kevin Garnett (1997-98, 2000-02, 07), LaMarcus Aldridge (2012-16, 18), Larry Bird (1980-81), Moses Malone (1986-89), Patrick Ewing(1988, 93, 95-96), Tim Duncan (2006, 2008-10, 13) Yao Ming (2006, 08-09)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear talent gap here in comparison to the previous cluster. Not only do we see inferior players here, but we also see some repeats of players in their statistically less productive seasons. Still, just as with cluster 1, there are still some great players here (like one of my favorite players of all time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5px4_cy_Qw&quot;&gt;Chris Bosh&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cluster 4: Jacks of All Trades&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closest-to-Centroid: &lt;i&gt;Chris Mullin (1990)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Players: &lt;i&gt;Chris Paul (2008-09), Dirk Nowitzki (2003, 05-07), Dwyane Wade (2006-07, 09-11), Gilbert Arenas (2006), Grant Hill (1997), James Harden (2013, 15-18), Kawhi Leonard (2017), Kevin Durant (2010, 12-14, 16-18), Kobe Bryant (2003, 06-08), Larry Bird (1985-88), LeBron James (2005-18), Magic Johnson (1987, 1990), Michael Jordan (1985, 87-97), Russell Westbrook (2015-17)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the guys that the basketball world would consider some of the most elite, MVP-calibre players in the history of the game. Most of these players are guard/wing types, with the exception of the occasional Dirk Nowitzki (who, in many ways, statistically resembles a wing player in his scoring methods). Just as with cluster 2, most choices here are respectable stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cluster 5: Pure Scorers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closest-to-Centroid: &lt;i&gt;Jim Paxson (1983)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Players: &lt;i&gt;Allen Iverson (2000-06, 08), Carmelo Anthony (2007-08, 10-14), Clyde Drexler (1988-91), Demar DeRozan (2016-18), Dirk Nowitzki (2002, 04, 08-11), Dominique Wilkins (1986-91, 93-94), George Gervin (1980-84), Gilbert Arenas (2007), Kobe Bryant (2001-02, 04-05, 09, 11-13), Larry Bird (1984, 90), Michael Jordan (1998, 2002), Paul Pierce (2002-03, 06), Russell Westbrook (2011-13, 18), Stephon Marbury (2001), Steve Francis (2003), Tracy McGrady (2001-02, 04-07), Vince Carter (2000-01, 05-07)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this cluster, we have a good amount of high volume scorers in their primes. In today's environment of NBA analysis where efficiency is heralded as king, I think this list of players would give Advanced NBA Twitter a collective aneurysm. Still, many of these players are bonafide studs, and a volume scorer can serve a great function on a team (especially in an all-time lineup, where we can assign their roles to our liking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cluster 6: Defensive Bigs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closest-to-Centroid: &lt;i&gt;Chris Bosh (2014)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Players: &lt;i&gt;Alonzo Mourning (2002), Andre Drummond (2016, 18). Ben Wallace (2004-06), Bill Laimbeer (1983-84, 87), Charles Oakley (1994), Chris Bosh (2013-14), Dennis Rodman (1990, 92), Dikembe Mutombo (1992, 95-98, 2000-02), Draymond Green (2016-18), Dwight Howard (2007, 13-14), Joakim Noah (2013-14), Kevin Garnett (2009, 10-11, 13), Robert Parish (1985-87, 90-91), Shaquille O'Neal (2007, 09), Tim Duncan (2011, 15)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the players we look back on for their defense pop up here, including Charles Oakley, Dennis Rodman, Bill Laimbeer and Ben Wallace. It is also interesting to note that some great big men in the later stages of their careers are present, such as past-their-primes Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan. This makes sense, as a defensive-minded big is often the role a once-marquee big man plays once they take a backseat from their previous alpha role on a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cluster 7: 3&amp;D(istributor?)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closest-to-Centroid: &lt;i&gt;Peja Stojakovic (2002)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Players: &lt;i&gt;Chauncey Billups (2006-10), Chris Paul (2011-16), Damian Lillard (2014-15, 18), Deron Williams (2010-11), Gary Payton (1995-98, 2000), Gordon Hayward (2017), Jimmy Butler (2015), John Stockton (1989-97, 2000), Kemba Walker (2017-18), Klay Thompson (2015-16), Kyle Lowry (2016-18), Kyrie Irving (2015, 17-18), Magic Johnson (1980, 83-86, 88, 91), Paul George (2014, 16, 18), Paul Pierce (2005, 08, 10-11), Peja Stojakovic (2002-04), Ray Allen (2000-02, 04-06, 08-09, 11), Reggie Miller (1990, 95-96, 98, 2000), Scottie Pippen (1995-97), Stephen Curry (2014-15, 17-18), Steve Nash (2002-03, 05-06, 08, 10, 12)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was probably the most fascinating cluster, as it had a mix of two somewhat distinct player types: distributors and 3&amp;D wings. To further investigate, I carried out a method recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/so-you-have-some-clusters-now-what-abfd297a575b&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; to extract feature importance in clusters. First, I constructed a random forest model that predicted the probability of every player belonging to the 7th cluster. Then, using a built-in function in the randomForest library in R, I saw which variables were most important in construction of the model. This showed me that in determining whether a player was in the 7th cluster or not, the two most important variables were 2 Pointers Attempted Per Game and 3-Point Attempt Rate (percentage of field goal attempts that were 3-pointers). Here are boxplots of those variables across all clusters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kmeansAll/pic_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kmeansAll/pic_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, in most cases, players in cluster 7 took less 2-pointers than players in other clusters, and generally took far more 3-pointers than players in other clusters. Generally, floor generals might not take as many 2-pointers as other players since they are looking more to move the ball than score for themselves. However, they are often good spot-up shooters from the arc, since those are the open shots they get when the defense collapses. On the other hand, a sniper from 3-point land will obviously be more inclined to take more 3-pointers and less 2-pointers to help their team with that sweet extra point. Thus, it makes sense that the clustering algorithm would group dimers and 3-point specialists together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making sense of each cluster, I had to choose the five clusters that I would pick players from for my ultimate starting lineup. I did not consider players from clusters 1 and 3 in my lineup construction, since the players in those clusters were either inferior to players in other clusters or displayed redundant skillsets. Here are my picks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;G: Magic Johnson (1986)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cluster 7: 3&amp;D(istributor?)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kmeansAll/pic_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Peter Read Miller, Sports Illustrated&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic Johnson is, indisputably, one of the greatest point guards of all time. I wanted a floor general from my lineup who is not only an excellent passer but can also completely shut down the opposing point guard on defense. At 6'9 and 215 pounds, and a season where he lead the league in assists, Magic fits the perfect mold for my team's point guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;G: Michael Jordan (1996)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cluster 4: Jacks of All Trades&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kmeansAll/pic_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Walter Iooss Jr., Sports Illustrated&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a tough one, and likely a divisive pick. Cluster 4 had absolutely excellent players, with the two highlights being LeBron James and Michael Jordan in their prime seasons. Now, my picking of MJ over LeBron here is not representative of my stake in the GOAT debate. I just thought that for this team, LeBron's talents might not be the greatest fit with Magic at the helm, especially considering how supremely talented they both are as passers. For my second guard spot, I valued a guy who could score from anywhere on the floor, no matter who is guarding him or what the time on the clock is. I think no one in the history of basketball fits this profile better than Michael Jeffrey Jordan (in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk6uKC4nJ-U&quot;&gt;Skip Bayless voice&lt;/a&gt;). And what better version of MJ to pick than him in the 1995-96 season, when he lead the Bulls to a legendary 72-10 record and finished the job in the playoffs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgVOgGLtPtc&quot;&gt;something that a certain other team couldn't do&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;F: Larry Bird (1984)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cluster 5: Pure Scorers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kmeansAll/pic_6.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Focus on Sport/Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted a player here who could play the ultimate second banana to Michael Jordan. I wanted the absolute peak form of the 3&amp;D archetype, so that this lineup could have one player who could always be a consistent scorer on the wing via spot-up shooting or the occasional iso, so as to lay some of the stress off MJ. Think of Klay Thompson, but on steroids. To fill this role, I took 1984 MVP Larry Bird. In looking at the players in the &quot;Pure Scorers&quot; cluster, the Laker stan in me really wanted to take the rightful MVP of the 2006 NBA season, Kobe Bryant. However, Bird was the better shooter, would likely be more willing to accept a secondary role on a team, and also had a bigger body to guard opposing wings. Am I relegating Larry Bird to a role that is far beneath his belt? Perhaps. But I feel putting him in a position like this would maximize his talents to the nth degree, since he would not have to carry the load he was used to on this team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;F: Draymond Green (2017)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cluster 6: Defensive Bigs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kmeansAll/pic_7.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my truly controversial pick. I definitely wanted a player from the &quot;Defensive Bigs&quot; cluster in my lineup, since having a good defender in the interior is so important in the NBA game. However, I wanted someone with at least a little bit of offensive prowess, just so that he could hit the occasional three or make a nice wing pass every once in a while. Thus, I narrowed my selections down to Draymond Green and Robert Parish. From here, I had to decide which I valued more: a defensive Swiss Army knife with good passing ability or a quick paint presence who could stretch the floor. Ultimately, I went with 2017 Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green. I am certainly influenced by the &quot;switch everything&quot; philosophy that has permeated basketball in recent years, but I do think it is a sound defensive strategy that is bound to lead to success. And with this lineup, we now have four relatively big-bodied players who can switch 1-4 pretty easily, anchored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7KICA7KNqs&quot;&gt;one of the smartest, most vocal defensive leaders&lt;/a&gt; I have personally witnessed play basketball. On top of his defensive prowess, he can also step out beyond the arc every now and then, and also make some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruEfcAgebzU&quot;&gt;truly excellent passes&lt;/a&gt; in the flow of the offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;C: Shaquille O'Neal (2000)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cluster 2: Cream of the Crop Big Men&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/kmeansAll/pic_8.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Andrew D. Bernstein, Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most dominant big men of all time. Need I say more? Shaquille O'Neal, in his MVP season, was a force to be reckoned with on both ends of the floor. Having Shaq in the paint is one of the best insurance policies this lineup could have. Jordan and Bird both having off nights? Feed the ball to Shaq down low and let him feast. In his prime, Shaq could also &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/tGHv_Mst5P8&quot;&gt;hold his own against some of the greatest big men of all time&lt;/a&gt;.  A crafty player somehow gets through the rotating carousel of my four elite defenders? Let him try to finish over Shaq in the paint. Especially given that this was the season he turned up his defensive intensity and earned his first NBA All-Defensive Team selection, he would be quite menacing for opposing players near the basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think my lineup would stack up well against anyone else's all time starting five. On the offensive side, I have three of the most dominant bucket-getters in the history of basketball in Jordan, Bird and Shaq, arguably the greatest floor general of all time in Magic and an excellent secondary distributor to keep the ball rolling in Draymond. On the defensive end, I have four of the smartest and most tenacious defenders to ever play the game, with enough size to seamlessly switch onto any guard or forward thrown at them, PLUS The Big Aristotle lurking in the paint. I promise you, no one is scoring on this lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we go by the clusters, my lineup has an amazing distributor, a jack of all trades, a pure scorer, a defensive big and a cream-of-the-crop big. If this isn't a formula for a wonderfully balanced all-time starting lineup, I don't know what is. I am quite pleased with the team I have constructed, and would be willing to take on a debate with any challengers who have a starting five that they think could beat mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really though, &lt;i&gt;who is scoring on these guys?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After taking nearly half of the season to earn the starting job, his performance caused major concern for the future. As noted in a May 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/72405/57/nfls-best-qb-situations-2017?pg=3&quot;&gt;Rotoworld article&lt;/a&gt;, Goff's rookie season was historically bad: &quot;Of the 49 rookie quarterbacks to make at least seven starts since 2000, Goff posted the fourth-lowest touchdown total (five), sixth-lowest YPA (5.31), 15th-worst QB rating (63.6) and 22nd-worst completion percentage (54.6).&quot; Coming into the 2017 NFL football season, some even postulated that new coach Sean McVay might select QB Sean Mannion to lead the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, and the narrative surrounding Goff has changed tremendously. Not only is he at the helm of the new generation of a great Rams offense, but his numbers are also at the top of the league. In addition to grading out as the 3rd best quarterback by Pro Football Focus (behind Drew Brees and Patrick Mahomes), Goff is 3rd in QBR, Yards Thrown, and Yards per Attempt. Even as part of a star studded team which boasts Todd Gurley, Aaron Donald, and Brandin Cooks, Goff is third in MVP odds at +1600.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such a rapid improvement in quarterback performance, there are many possible explanation for such success. It seems clear that while the improvements in skill position talent and scheme have allowed Goff to flourish, he has also seen a natural progression in performance that showcases the talent that got him drafted number one overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/goffStory/pic_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Todd Gurley and Robert Woods are two of Goff's biggest weapons in a stacked offense&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theory #1: Goff is a product of the playmakers around him&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a quarterback has both the Offensive Player of the Year (Todd Gurley) and Defensive Player of the Year (Aaron Donald) on their team, it would seem likely that their success is largely based on the skill players around them. In fact, when Goff began to succeed in the 2017 season, much of his role seemed to be due to handing the ball off or throwing screen passes to Gurley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Goff's role in the offense is far larger than handoffs, bubble screens and short passes. In fact, according to Pro Football Focus, Jared Goff leads the NFL this season with 29 &quot;big time throws&quot;, which are throws that &quot;require special ball placement and timing down the field.&quot; Another great statistic that indicates that Goff is not simply a dink and dunk player is the Next Gen Stat &quot;Air Yards to the Sticks.&quot; This statistic indicates how far in the air a quarterback throws the ball beyond the first down marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/goffStory/pic_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The variable dAYTS represents the change in the statistic over the last two years (between Goff's rookie year and current year), and the graph shows all quarterbacks over the last two years. While this is not a great measurement of quarterback performance, since it measures attempts rather than completions, it does show that Goff is pushing the ball further down the field rather than sticking with short throws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at the actual number, Goff went from -2.1 to 0.0 in AYTS, exhibiting a huge jump of 2.1 air yards. What's most important to note regarding this is that even as the skill of the position players around Goff has improved, the throws he has started to attempt have been further down the field. Usually, a system quarterback with good skill position players will have a negative AYTS because they will rely on the skill player to gain the yards. To contrast with Goff, you can look at Eli Manning's value of -2.3 AYTS this year. While both players have dynamic running backs with pass catching ability (Gurley and Barkley) as well as talented receivers (Beckham and Cooks), Manning's AYTS is 2.3 yards lower than Goff's. This shows that Goff has innate skill in his game that is outside the talent around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Manager Les Snead made a key move during the 2017 NFL offseason by signing All-Pro tackle Andrew Whitworth. Coming off a season in which tackle Greg Robinson gave up 8 sacks and 40 QB pressures on pass blocking plays (according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-ranking-all-32-nfl-offensive-lines-this-season&quot;&gt;Pro Football Focus&lt;/a&gt;), the Rams recognized the need to protect their young quarterback. The improvement of the line has been clear, as they currently rank as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-2018-nfl-offensive-line-rankings-all-32-teams-units-after-week-12&quot;&gt;number 2&lt;/a&gt; overall offensive line unit in the league according to Pro Football Focus. The biggest beneficiary of the improved offensive line has been Jared Goff, specifically in the amount of time he has to throw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/goffStory/pic_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a greater amount of time to throw, quarterbacks are able to sit back in the pocket and make better throws. While not all great quarterbacks need time to throw, allowing them to be in a pocket with more time and less pressure is usually a recipe for success. Therefore, while Goff has improved his own game in terms of decision-making and down the field throwing, he has also benefited from improved offensive line personnel.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/goffStory/pic_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Head Coach Sean McVay has helped turn around Goff's career&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theory #2: Goff is a product of the McVay's Offensive Scheme&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean McVay, hired as the youngest ever head coach in 2017, quickly turned around the offense. After concerns over a limited track record, McVay silenced the critics by turning the Rams from the lowest scoring offense in 2016 to the highest scoring offense in 2017, a historically unprecedented improvement. With Goff improving under McVay's system, the media rushed to categorize Goff a &quot;system quarterback&quot;. However, McVay himself has scoffed at the claim, stating Goff does the majority of the on the field work: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therams.com/news/goff-unbothered-by-talk-of-system-qb&quot;&gt;He's making the throws, he's making the calls at the line of scrimmage, he's making the calls in the huddle.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; The best way to determine how much of Goff's success is due to McVay is to compare his performance with a previous quarterback's performance with McVay at the helm. The following graph compares Kirk Cousins' 2016 season (with McVay as Offensive Coordinator) with Jared Goff's 2018 season.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/goffStory/pic_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The graph indicates that Goff is a statistically superior version of Cousins in nearly every category. Goff has nearly identical Aggressiveness and Completion Percentages, but has a greater Rating and QBR. DVOA and VOA, statistics measuring a quarterbacks performance against a defense compared to a theoretical backup, also conclude that Goff has performed at a greater level than Cousins. However, it should be stated that part of this better performance can be attributed to the better talent surrounding Goff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A perfect example of the combination between McVay's offensive scheme marrying Goff's precision passing came in the earlier this year in a Thursday Night Football game against the Minnesota Vikings. After faking the handoff to Todd Gurley, Goff waits in the pocket while reading the defense. Soon, he sees Cooper Kupp streaking down the field covered by linebacker Anthony Barr. Recognizing the mismatch, Goff catches Kupp perfectly in stride as he runs in for a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pGtHAWxEtSc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McVay's offensive genius used Gurley to bait the defensive line into thinking it was a run play, while sending other wide receivers Robert Woods and Brandin Cooks streaking towards the left side of the field. Gurley, running a wheel route, drew safety Harrison Smith, which opened up the entire right side of the field to Kupp. However, Goff still needed to place the ball correctly in order to allow Kupp to make the catch and score. McVay deserves credit for putting Goff in a position to succeed, but by no means does he baby him with an offense any quarterback could execute. Rather, McVay has crafted an offense that maximizes the abilities of Goff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theory #3: Goff has independently improved over the last two years&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn on the tape of Goff as a rookie and you'll see a player who is making erratic short throws, running for his life, and forcing the issue. Watch the tape of Goff this year and the change is dramatic. Goff stands with poise, fires dimes, and nearly always makes the right read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One statistic that can show this change is the next generation statistic known as &quot;Aggressiveness Percentage.&quot; According to the Next Gen Stats glossary, &quot;aggressiveness tracks the amount of passing attempts a quarterback makes that are into tight coverage, where there is a defender within 1 yard or less of the receiver at the time of completion or incompletion.&quot; Therefore, aggressiveness is a good measurement of proper decision making, as an aggressive quarterback takes more risks and therefore has a greater chance of turning the ball over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/goffStory/pic_6.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Over the last two seasons, Goff has had one of the sharpest drops in aggressiveness. He went from leading the league with more than one-fourth of his passes being within 1 yard or less of a defender to a reasonable 14.7% in 2018. This would indicate that Goff has become more comfortable with his offense and is not forcing passes into tight windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/goffStory/pic_7.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
	


&lt;p&gt;In addition to being less reckless with the football, Goff's passer rating has improved by nearly 50 points over the last two years. Once again, his improvement leads all quarterbacks over the two year period. The basic formula for passer rating attempts to maximize touchdowns, completions and yards while minimizing attempts and interceptions. On a more holistic level, Goff's quarterback performance has gone from one of the worst in the league to one of the best in the league.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One play that truly shows the improvement Goff has made from his rookie season came in a week 4 game against the Minnesota Vikings. Rather than throw the ball out of bounds or overshoot the receiver, Goff floats a spiraling ball over two defenders right into the hands of Cooper Kupp for the touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zyUKe7u9Ws&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That play highlighted the marquee game of Goff's young career. Putting up a statline of 465 yards on 26 completions, 5 touchdowns and 0 interceptions, Goff became the 70th quarterback in NFL history to earn a perfect passer rating in a game. Even more impressive, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1045513608426184704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1045513608426184704&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FESPNStatsInfo%2Fstatus%2F1045513608426184704&quot;&gt;tweet by @ESPNStatsandInfo&lt;/a&gt;, Goff was the first quarterback to throw 400+ yards and 5 TD on 3 days of rest. No matter how good an offensive scheme is, pure talent is necessary to put on a performance like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article attempted to find a totalizing theory for Goff's rapid improvement, but the truth of the matter is that all have validity. It's obvious that surrounding Goff with a better offensive line, more explosive wide receivers, and a stacked defensive line will improve his numbers. However, similar talent situations exists on other teams (such as Dallas and New York), and those teams clearly do not have the same level of success. Obviously having a genius mind like Sean McVay calling the shots allows Goff to be put in good schematic situations with easy reads and throws. However, Goff still represents an improvement over McVay's previous quarterback, Kirk Cousins. In addition, Goff's abysmal rookie season has several confounding variables- an incompetent head coach, a lack of an offensive line and terrible game scripts that forced Goff to make plays he wasn't able to. Any quarterback could have success under McVay's system, but Goff's performance doesn't fit the mold of a system quarterback. He has been able to transcend defensive schemes and produce big plays, something he couldn't do before. Therefore, Goff's improvement is a combination of the talent and coach around him along with the innate skill he possesses as a franchise quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/goffStory/pic_8.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Goff celebrates a touchdown in a Rams win over Kansas City in Week 11&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jared Goff may not have the arm talent of Patrick Mahomes, the dual-threat ability of Deshaun Watson, or the toughness of Carson Wentz, but the Rams did not make a mistake by using their first overall pick on him in the 2016 draft. He has shown massive improvement, topping the league in terms of change in nearly every single statistical category. The Rams have their quarterback for the future, and their window for a Super Bowl run is wide open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 3, 2018, the French publication France Football will announce the winner of this year's Ballon d'Or, which translates to the &quot;Golden Ball&quot;. The award, which recognizes the best male footballer in the world, has been around for a while now.  In fact, this will be the 53rd time that it will be awarded. Every year, the speculation around who the eventual winner will be creates a ton of buzz, and this year is no different. Before we join in on that hype train, let's take a look at how the &quot;Golden Ball&quot; has exchanged hands over the last of couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To any football fan, it would come as no shock to learn that ever since 2008, the award has been shared by just two players - Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Both have secured 5 Ballon d'Ors each (or the FIFA Ballon d'Or, as it was known from 2010 to 2015) in the last decade. Ever since Kaka picked up the award in 2007 after a terrific season with A.C. Milan, Ronaldo and Messi's sheer dominance of the game has made the Ballon d'Or a two-horse race, with the rest of the world just battling to earn a place alongside them in the top three. This year, however, that could very well change.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo with his 5 Ballon d'Ors (Credit: AFP/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When France Football announced the 30-man shortlist on October 9, there were not many surprises. The usual suspects including Ronaldo, Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar were all included. However, the members of the World Cup winning France team are the ones making headway in the race to win the prestigious award. With only a week to go, the press is speculating that Ronaldo and Messi will not even finish in the top three. So if Ronaldo and Messi aren't the favorites, who can snag up the Ballon d'Or?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are the contenders?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask the bookmakers, it is the Croatian midfielder Luka Modric who is by far the favorite. Winning his fourth UEFA Champions League with Real Madrid was probably enough to earn him a nomination, but it was his incredible display in Russia that has made him the favorite in the eyes of the press, as well as the bookies. Under his leadership, Croatia became the runners up in what was a fairytale run up to the finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup . Modric picked up 3 Man of the Match trophies along the way, while also snatching the award for the Best Player of the Tournament, which is also coincidentally titled the Golden Ball. He also led the field in terms of the most miles covered during the tournament, which goes to show how much work he put in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luka Modric with his Best Player of the Tournament Award (Credit: Reuters)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the incredible performance in Russia, he received a lot of praise and accolades, as he went on to beat his Real Madrid teammate Ronaldo and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah to win both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player awards. Winning these two individual awards have bolstered his chances of picking up the Ballon d'Or as well. However, a poor start to the new season with Real Madrid, which resulted in the sacking of the newly appointed manager Julen Lopetegui, and Croatia's relegation to League B in the inaugural season of the UEFA Nations League, have shown that Modric has failed to capitalize on an amazing summer. While this poor post-World Cup performance might deter some people to vote for him, most believe that it won't be enough to deny him his first Ballon d'Or.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the fact that it was Modric's World Cup performance that has put him in front of the race, it isn't shocking that the other front runners also had a tremendous World Cup campaign. The French World Cup winning trio of Antoine Griezmann, Kylian Mbappe, and Raphael Varane are hot on Modric's tail to get the nod for the honor. Griezmann, the Atletico Madrid forward, has been consistently performing at the top level for years now, and 2018 for him wasn't any different. He helped Atletico lift the UEFA Europa League and was named the Europa League's Player of the Season for his efforts. He continued his exceptional form in Russia as well. By scoring 4 goals and chipping in with 2 assists, he helped France secure the World Cup. He also snatched up the Man of the Match award in the World Cup final.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 3&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&gt;Antoine Griezmann, Raphael Varane and Kylian Mbappe representing France in the 2018 FIFA World Cup (Credit: Goal.com)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Griezmann was the focal point of the French forward line, it was the 19 year old Paris Saint-Germain winger who was garnering a lot of attention for all the right reasons. The 2017-18 season ended with Mbappe lifting the Ligue 1 title as well as the Coupe de France in what was a really successful first season for him in Paris. He quickly followed that up with a stunning World Cup performance. He scored two against Argentina and scored with a brilliant 25 yard strike against Croatia in the final, which led to him winning the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player Award. The 2018-19 season has gone off to a blistering start for him. His numbers are a lot higher as compared to the previous season in almost every aspect. While he is a strong contender to win the Ballon d'Or, he is also the outright favorite to lift the Kopa Trophy, which is awarded by France Football to the best performing player under the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the third member of the French team who has also been in the limelight is the Real Madrid centre-back Varane. Along with Sergio Ramos, he formed the backbone of Real Madrid's defense as they lifted the UEFA Champions League trophy in yet another successful campaign in Europe. He carried that success over in Russia as he helped the French defense keep 4 clean sheets on their way to victory. He was the anchor of the French defense, and he even scored the opening goal in the quarterfinal win against Uruguay. If he does win, he will be the first defender since Fabio Cannavaro to do so, who had led Italy as they were crowned the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions. However, Varane's bid to win the award has suffered the same blow as Modric's, as Real Madrid's dismal performance during the start of this 2018-19 season has left them in 6th place in the La Liga standings. Madrid's shaky defense has played a significant role in their poor form, and Varane hasn't done nearly enough to be immune from the blame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ronaldo and Messi haven't had a bad year either by any standards. Cristiano Ronaldo, along with his Real Madrid teammates, won the UEFA Champions League for the third consecutive year. Moreover, he had a decent performance in Russia as well, scoring 4 goals (including a hattrick) against Spain. Following the World Cup, Ronaldo again made headlines by transferring to Juventus. While many were skeptical about how successful he'd be in Italy, he has proved his critics wrong by quickly adapting to the Series A and he's currently the joint top scorer while also being second in terms of assists. Messi, on the other hand, won the domestic double as he played an integral role in another one of FC Barcelona's dominant seasons in Spain. Although a disappointing summer in Russia hampered his hopes of ever winning the biggest tournament in football, it has been business as usual for Messi and his Barcelona teammates. They are at the top of their Champions League group and second in La Liga, trailing Sevilla by just one point. While they aren't the favorites anymore, it can't be denied that both of them have again had a tremendous year individually, while also picking up some silverware along the way. These two have perennially been at the top of the football world, and even though the dynamics are changing, they aren't leaving anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 4&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Salah celebrating after scoring a goal (Credit: Reuters)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounding up the list of possible contenders is Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah. He took the Premier League by storm last year as he became the top scorer with 32 goals, which is the highest tally since Alan Shearer's 34 goal haul during the 1994-95 season. Add to that the fact that Liverpool completely surpassed expectations and reached the UEFA Champions League finals, and you've got yourself the perfect candidate for the Ballon d'Or. Unfortunately for Salah, he was subbed in the first half of the Champions League final after suffering a shoulder injury, and had to watch his teammates suffer defeat at the hands of  Real Madrid. The injury also played a role in limiting his participation in the World Cup. Despite that, he managed to score both of Egypt's goals in the tournament. The fact that he was nominated in the top three for both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player should have paved the way for him to be a serious contender for the Ballon d'Or, but the sheer dominance of the French trio mentioned above has pushed him down the list of favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do the stats say?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ballon d'Or takes into consideration a player's performance during the calendar year. So we're going to focus on the stats beginning from January 1, 2018. Furthermore, in a year like this, where the center of attention has undoubtedly been the FIFA World Cup, the year can be looked at as a tale of two halves. Separating the players' stats into what happened before, during, and after the World Cup can help us better analyze the numbers. Since the players play in different countries and participate in different competitions, it can often skew the statistics. For instance, the domestic cup in different countries follow different formats. England has two domestic cups in which a single knockout game decides the outcome of each game, whereas in Spain, there's only one domestic cup in which there are knockout rounds played over two legs. Since the domestic league and the UEFA Champions League are at the top of the clubs' and players' priorities, focusing on the stats from just these two competitions, along with the FIFA World Cup, can help us better make sense of each player's performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pool of probable winners consists of 5 forwards, 1 midfielder, and 1 defender. Now the most important statistic in any football game is the number of goals. Looking at the chart for the total goals scored in the domestic league, Champions League ( Europa League in Griezmann's case), and the World Cup since January 1, it will come as no surprise that Ronaldo and Messi are comfortably leading. Obviously one can't expect a creative midfielder like Modric to match the numbers achieved by such prolific forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 5&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Shot Accuracy (Shots On Target/Total Attempts) and the Shots Attempted per game, it makes sense why it is highly unlikely for a player like Modric to ever reach Ronaldo's or Messi's numbers. Unsurprisingly, Ronaldo has more attempts per game than the rest. Modric attempts less than a fifth of the numbers of shots that his former Real Madrid teammate does. The far fewer attempts, which is typical for a creative midfielder, explains why he trails the others by such a huge margin in terms of goals. Messi is the only player with a shot accuracy of over 50%, whereas Modric has the worst percentage. This can be attributed to the fact that more than half of Modric's attempts come from outside the box, whereas the others have a much higher percentage of their attempts coming from inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 6&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
		&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 7&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might expect Modric with his incredible passing, link-up play, and set piece duty to comfortably led the charts for assists and chances created, but that is not the case. Messi, Griezmann, and Salah all have created more chances and have more assists in all competitions. One interesting point that is evident from the graphs is that Mbappe's performance before the World Cup wasn't anywhere close to his competitors. It is his recent burst of form, a continuation of his World Cup exploits, which has helped him gain a lot of ground in the Ballon d'Or race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 8&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these aren't the categories in which Modric is producing the best figures, then one might wonder why he is the favorite to lift the Ballon d'Or. His role as a playmaker compels him to focus more on building the attack. Receiving the ball from the defense and channeling it to the forwards is something that he is really good at, and his role in the center of the pitch allows him to connect both the flanks as well. This is made evident through the passing stats. He has completed the most passes per game, with Messi close behind him. Furthermore, Modric also helps out the team defensively, which is also an important factor. For instance, looking at the interception numbers, we can see that his defensive contributions outweigh that of the rest by quite a margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 10&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
	
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 11&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varane is the only defender in our list of favorites. Unlike his Real Madrid teammate Marcelo, who bursts forward down the left wing quite a bit and chips in with goals and assists, Varane sticks to his centre-back duties. Looking at the data of goals conceded and the number of clean sheets can hence provide a good understanding of actually how successful he has been during this year. Comparing his stats to that of fellow La Liga centre-backs, Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin and FC Barcelona's Samuel Umtiti can help us gauge his performance relative to his peers. Looking at the graphs, it is clear that fellow Ballon d'Or nominee Godin's performances have been much more solid defensively. Even Varane's partner in the French back line, Umtiti, who wasn't even in the 30-man shortlist, has produced better numbers. As it is evident from these stats, Varane's defensive abilities don't measure up to that of his counterparts. This does bring his candidacy for the award into question.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 12&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
	
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/messiDor/pic_13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 13&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can we expect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ballon d'Or is notorious for creating controversy. Disagreements over who the winner should be always takes center stage, and this year is no different. The Ballon d'Or uses the following criteria to rank players and select the eventual winner: (1) Individual and collective performances (winners) during the year, (2) Player class (talent and fair play), and (3) Overall judgment of the player's career. While the first is something that we can quantitatively measure, the other two are rather subjective, which might make it seem to the uninitiated that the Ballon d'Or is awarded quite arbitrarily. Most of the criticism regarding the selection process has often been about favoritism of one player over the other. The second and third criterions do allow some intrinsic factors to play a role in the decision. Due to this, it is entirely possible for the numbers to tell a story completely different than what the journalists deciding the winner choose to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All seven of the players that I've talked about have had an outstanding year and while it would be justifiable if any one of them received the honor, it would be a surprise for most if Modric fails to add to his collection of accolades that he has received this year. It can be argued that his stats aren't the most impressive, but a lot of what he adds to the team, whether it be in terms of skill or leadership, can't be quantified through mere numbers. For each of the last 5 years, the Ballon d'Or has gone to a member of the UEFA Champions League winning team, which also bodes well for Modric. This does show how much stress they put on &quot;collective performances&quot; and the fact that this was a World Cup year, it is bound to play even more of a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With France winning the World Cup, Griezmann, Mbappe, and Varane have all cemented their names in the history books. However, the fact that France had a strong overall squad takes the spotlight away from their individual brilliance. They might not win the Ballon d'Or this year, but they are all young and still have a lot of years ahead of them, and it will be interesting to see how much they can improve in the seasons to come. Similarly, Salah also had a tremendous season and no one expected him to achieve the feats that he did. He could also potentially be a Ballon d'Or winner in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ronaldo and Messi aren't the favorites, they do have the stats on their side. Both have won prestigious silverware and have displayed excellent form throughout the year. The last 10 years of Ballon d'Or have just been about these 2 extraordinary legends of the sport and both of them are still a force to be reckoned with. They show no signs of fading away as they continue to dominate the top-tiers of football in Europe. Despite their strong display, it is almost certain that on December 3, we will have a new heir to the football throne. This year has surely signaled a change in the footballing landscape and with new talents being discovered every single season, we might not have a duopoly, like the one we've seen for the past decade, for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources: Goal.com, Squawka.com, Soccerstats.com, Footystats.org, Francefootball.fr&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vedant Sahu</name></author><summary type="html">On December 3, 2018, the French publication France Football will announce the winner of this year's Ballon d'Or, which translates to the &quot;Golden Ball&quot;. The award, which recognizes the best male footballer in the world, has been around for a while now. In fact, this will be the 53rd time that it will be awarded. Every year, the speculation around who the eventual winner will be creates a ton of buzz, and this year is no different. Before we join in on that hype train, let's take a look at how the &quot;Golden Ball&quot; has exchanged hands over the last of couple of years.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Can the Toronto Maple Leafs Pay Up?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/NHLContracts" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Can the Toronto Maple Leafs Pay Up?" /><published>2018-11-28T14:55:02-08:00</published><updated>2018-11-28T14:55:02-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/NHLContracts</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/NHLContracts">&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that William Nylander has held out on signing a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. As a restricted free agent about to enter into his first non-entry level NHL contract, Nylander is very limited in his options: sign with the Leafs, or don't play at all. Players rarely choose not to play at all, with many top six players opting for bridge deals - three-to-four year contracts typically valued far less than they wish in exchange for an opportunity to prove themselves more capable of a future contract more extensive in both term and salary. It is also common for players to begin negotiations asking for high pay, only to settle for what they were actually hoping for. What makes Nylander's situation unique isn't that he reportedly asked for upward of $8 million per year (money typically reserved for roughly top two talent on a team), but that he has not since backed down and signed for less. Against everyone's expectations, it is now late November, the Leafs have played over a quarter of the season, and they are still without the 22 year old Swede.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nylander's holdout begs the question: how much money should he sign for? In order to come to any sort of conclusion, one must first consider what exactly goes into the value of a contract. Player ability, clearly, is the most important variable. To find a comparison, data was used from all 965 NHL players from the 2017-18 season. For issues of sample size, a minimum of 50 games played was set, bringing the total down to 513 players. To better fit Nylander's situation, only forwards 25 years or younger were considered. Finally, only players with contracts of over $1 million per year AAV (Average Annual Value, per Cap Friendly) were included to prevent entry level contracts from significantly altering conclusions - it would be unwise to compare contract sizes otherwise when Art Ross winner Connor McDavid was only paid $925 thousand for the season. In the end, 67 players are left that fit the criteria described above. How does Nylander stack up to these 67?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most obvious comparison to draw is how many points each player earned. In the chart below, total points are plotted against contract sizes. The vertical blue line is where Nylander's 61 points would place him among his peers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nhlCon/cover.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 1&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This result may be surprising to someone that has followed the Nylander situation. While his initial request for $8 million has been deemed ridiculously high by most, it has been generally thought that he would end up receiving a contract in the $6 million to $7 million range. The linear model places Nylander very near the $5 million mark based on contracts of those with similar point totals to his. Also noteworthy is how less-than-stellar the chart makes out Nylander to be as a scorer. Though it should be stressed again that the chart is only showing young players that make over $1 million per year - you won't find many fourth line grinders here - it is interesting to point out that, among those in similar circumstances, Nylander's point total isn't exactly elite. One may consider that Nylander wasn't playing top line minutes for the Maple Leafs (about 16 minutes per game), and that total playing time (including loss of time due to injury) greatly affects year end point totals. To compensate, an adjusted plot is shown below this time using points-per-sixty minutes played along the x-axis. The result is a more linear plot, but with near identical findings in regards to Nylander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nhlCon/pic_1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, points do not tell the entire tale of player ability. However, while other statistics such as shooting percentage, Corsi, faceoff percentage (for centers), and point shares are clearly telling of how effective a player is, these statistics by themselves have little correlation when it comes to contract values, especially compared to simply the amount of points they put up. There is, as always, variation. Quality of line-mates certainly affects point totals, and it is likely that other statistics, including those listed above, have a lot to do with the variability about the regression line. But, the only other statistic that isn't directly derived from points that clearly relates to contract amounts is time on ice per game. At first glance, this appears trivial - better players get more playing time, who would've thought? - but the importance becomes more apparent when comparing two players on different teams with similar ability. Though nearly identical in skill, the one that gets more ice time per game will likely be paid more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nhlCon/pic_2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This leads to another observation: player ability is without a doubt connected to how much they get paid, but, perhaps more significantly, it is player importance to a team that determines how much the team is willing to pay. Teams are restricted by the salary cap, and do not have unlimited resources to provide their players. A center, regardless of skill, would likely be paid more by the Montreal Canadiens (who notably lack center depth) than the Pittsburgh Penguins (who have Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin already taking up positions). To relate this back to Nylander, it is enlightening to look at comparisons to a group of five other players around the NHL, who each have similar numbers and contracts set in stone and could be used as reference points. These players are Dylan Larkin, Jack Eichel, Jonathan Marchessault, Viktor Arvidsson, and Nikolaj Ehlers. The chart below is the same points-per-minute plot as before, but with these 5 players now marked in red (and Marchessault now added, as he did not meet the initial criteria due to age).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nhlCon/pic_3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few additional comments that should be made to give more insight into these players. Larkin, Eichel, and Ehlers each played last season at the same age as Nylander (21 years old). Arvidsson was 24 years old, but had his break-out year around the same time as the others listed. Marchessault was older at 27 years old last year, but also put up similar numbers to Nylander and signed a new contract for the 2018-19 season. In addition, Jack Eichel played only 67 games due to injury, weakening some of his statistics. Shown below is the points-per-minute for each of the players last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nhlCon/pic_4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nylander's points-per-minute is roughly the same as Arvidsson, Ehlers, and Eichel. Marchessault's higher value, being a more experienced player, can be seen as a reasonable expectation of growth for any of the other players listed. Larkin's value is lower, but that is partially accounted for with his abysmal 6.9% shooting percentage (significantly lower than his career average, which has returned to form currently in the 2018-19 season). The primary takeaway here should be how similar these players' offensive efficiencies are. The number of points put up by five of the six players (excluding Marchessault) was between 60 and 64; however, as seen below, the goal numbers vary considerably more. Compared to a player like Ehlers, the bulk of Nylander's points came through assists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nhlCon/pic_5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After accounting for Eichel's missing 15 games, it is clear that Nylander and Larkin are a step behind the others when it comes to putting the puck in the net. Finally, comparing each player's relative Corsi (percentage of shot attempts taken by the player's team when he is on the ice relative to other players on the same team) suggests Ehlers and Marchessault are a level above the others when it comes to driving possession, while Nylander again takes fifth out of the six players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;center&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;materialboxed responsive-img&quot; src =&quot;/assets/nhlCon/pic_6.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;picture 2&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 95%;&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, with the knowledge of how these players compare to each other in performance, it is revealing to compare their contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the cause for these significant differences? As discussed before, the importance to the team is possibly the most important factor in determining contract values - more-so than actual ability. This is especially the case for young players, who are locked in to their teams as restricted free agents. Jack Eichel is undoubtedly the franchise player for the Buffalo Sabres, whose next largest contract belongs to Kyle Okposo for $6 million per year. For the time being, nobody on the Sabres is as important to the organization as Eichel, and it certainly shows in his contract. The case is similar for Dylan Larkin. Despite only having a contract of $6.1 million, he is the highest paid player on the Detroit Red Wings, and would likely have been paid more had the team not had an expected $0 in cap space for the upcoming season (shown below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nikolaj Ehlers has an interesting contract of $6 million despite being the fifth highest-paid person on the Winnipeg Jets. However, the Jets are in a situation with enough cap space to sign such contracts. Jonathan Marchessault and Viktor Arvidsson (playing for the Vegas Golden Knights and the Nashville Predators, respectively) have lower contracts than the rest. In Marchessault's case, it is likely due to uncertainty of replication of last year's stats (something that could be said about much of the Golden Knights' season). For Arvidsson, it is a matter of being a very good player on a team of very great players - he is tied for seventh highest paid person on the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in these comparisons that the Nylander situation has evolved. William Nylander would likely be disappointed in Larkin's $6.1 million dollar contract. But it is simply fact that Nylander is not as important to the Toronto Maple Leafs - a team with incredible talent such as John Tavares, Morgan Reilly, and Patrick Marleau already signed to large contracts and with Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner requiring upcoming extensions - as Larkin is to the Red Wings. There just isn't space for the Maple Leafs and Nylander to come to a satisfactory deal, and if rumors of a near $7 million contract become true, it would likely end up hurting the Maple Leafs more than it helps. Unfortunately for Nylander, his standing with his team seems much more akin to Viktor Arvidsson than Jack Eichel. His raw stats suggest a $5 million contract and his reference players suggest $6 million, but his willingness to hold out and the financial state of his team suggest one of two options: either he gives in and signs for $5.5 million from Toronto, or his refusal to sign lands him roughly $6.5 million on a team that's able to pay. Either way, it is certain that Nylander will have a pivotal role on the team that signs him, and his play will certainly hold the interest of fans, if for no other reason than to see if record setting contract negotiations lead to equally impressive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Dunham</name></author><summary type="html">It's no secret that William Nylander has held out on signing a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. As a restricted free agent about to enter into his first non-entry level NHL contract, Nylander is very limited in his options, sign with the Leafs, or don't play at all. Players rarely choose not to play at all, with many top six players opting for bridge deals - three-to-four year contracts typically valued far less than they wish in exchange for an opportunity to prove themselves more capable of a future contract more extensive in both term and salary. It is also common for players to begin negotiations asking for high pay, only to settle for what they were actually hoping for. What makes Nylander's situation unique isn't that he reportedly asked for upward of $8 million per year (money typically reserved for roughly top two talent on a team), but that he has not since backed down and signed for less. Against everyone's expectations, it is now late November, the Leafs have played over a quarter of the season, and they are still without the 22 year old Swede.</summary></entry></feed>
