            <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/salJourney/avgSalDensity.png" alt="Salary Distribution"></center><figcaption></figcaption><p>With this article, we hope to detail our process as members of Bruin Sports Analytics to work towards getting a well-done research paper completed, with guidance given by our club advisor, Professor Almohalwas of the UCLA Statistics department. We wish to detail our journey, and all the lessons we have taken from each one to move us closer to completing our desired task. In hopes of creating a paper worthy of being published in an official sports analytics journal, we have decided to take more time in working towards our final result. However, we have decided to write this extended article to provide a checkpoint of where currently stand in hopes for others to get inspired to do research as an undergrad, and learn more about the interesting attempts we have tried to solve our problem.</p>
			
			<h2 style="font-family: Roboto slab, serif;"><a href="/sunsRockets">An In-Depth Comparison of the 06-07 Phoenix Suns and 17-18 Houston Rockets</a></h2>

            <h6 style="font-family: Roboto slab, serif;">09 Mar 2018 • 
                    
                      16 min read
                    </h6>
            <center><img class="excerptpics" src ="/assets/dantoni/cover.png" alt="Nash/Harden"></center><p>In Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals, Michael Jordan’s last game in a Chicago Bulls jersey, the Bulls attempted 67 field goals in the entire game, including only 10 three-point attempts. Fast forward to 2017-18, and the Houston Rockets are <i>averaging</i> 42.6 three-point field goal attempts per game. In the 20 years since Jordan’s last game, saying that professional basketball has changed would be an understatement. In today’s NBA, the “pace and space” style of play with an emphasis on a primary ball handler surrounded by shooters is the norm; all 30 teams are attempting at least 22 three-point field goals per game compared to the 2004 season, where only one team attempted more than 22 per game. Many of the offensive principles that are prevalent throughout the league can be attributed to current Rockets head coach, Mike D’Antoni. D'Antoni's success with the mid 2000s “Seven Seconds or Less” Phoenix Suns has had a lasting impact on the league today, as many of the same offensive philosophies have been commandeered by other coaches.</p>
			
			<h2 style="font-family: Roboto slab, serif;"><a href="/nbamidseason18">NBA Midseason Reflections</a></h2>

            <h6 style="font-family: Roboto slab, serif;">05 Feb 2018 • 
                    
                      9 min read
                    </h6>
            <p>The All Star lineups have been announced, most teams have played well over 45 games, we finally have a team openly tanking, and the Cavs all hate each other. So with that it's safe to say that the midway point of the NBA season has come and now would be a great time to reflect on the past couple months of the 2017-2018 season. By now everyone knows how great the Warriors are, how dysfunctional LeBron's team is, and that the Sacramento Kings are once again irrelevant. I wanted to take this time to deviate away from the major storylines in the season thus far and analyze some trends, statistics, coaching decisions, and quite simply things that really stand out to me. </p>
